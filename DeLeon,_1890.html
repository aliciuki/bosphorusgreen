<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="177">177</span></h2>
<p>Not have and alone the of sites Therapia and Buyukdere been skilfully selected with a view, both to the delight of the eye and benefit of the health,
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="178">178</span></h2>
<p>but the towns themselves,&#160;in those portions intended for the city migration, are well built and laid out, with pleasant walks along the border of the Bosphorus and Bay of Buyukdere, and good carriage roads lead out into the Forest of Belgrade and adjacent country.
</p><p>Unlike Constantinople, both on its Turkish and Christian sides, which is Paradise to look at from a distance, but Purgatory to enter into, in consequence of the sights, sounds, smells, and irregular rock-paved streets generally destitute of side-walks for pedestrians these two rural retreats are as agreeable inside as outside, unless you penetrate into the Greek-Armenian slums in their rear, where the poor congregate, and reproduce the nuisances of Pera and Stamboul.
</p><p>The very name given by the Greeks to Therapia (the place of healing), indicates its supposed sanitary qualities, and the name is well deserved: for the pure air, blowing down upon it, from the opening of the Black Sea, directly opposite, brings health and healing on its wings
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="179">179</span></h2>
<p>All summer this wind blows, with but a few exceptional days, when a warm wind comes from the south; and the only drawback is the humidity of the place, especially low down near the shore. On the heights, this can be escaped.
...
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="180">180</span></h2>
<p>In winter deserted by the corps diplomatique et consulaire, and people who took houses for the season, Therapia is left in possession of its three or four thousand permanent residents chiefly Greeks and Armenians small traders, shoemakers, butchers, vendors of fruit, and keepers of coffee shops; a very miscellaneous and poor population. But from the middle of May until the middle of October, Therapia is in its glory; as is also Buyukdere, both being redolent of diplomacy and society. The rides and drives in the neighbourhood are excellent, over well kept roads. But a few years
since they were regarded as dangerous, on account of brigands in the forest of Belgrade, though that branch of the Eastern fine arts was never carried to such perfection in Turkey as in Greece, and near Smyrna. In the latter place, at one time, it rose to the dignity of a recognised institution; as bull-fighting in Spain, or baksheesh in Egypt.&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="181">181</span></h2>
<p>Hence, riding parties used to be composed of several persons well armed, solitary persons being regarded as fair game by those irregular collectors of customs on the Sultan's highway.
</p><p>Few lovelier scenes does this beautiful world, in its most favoured spots, present than at Buyukdere, on a moonlight night, when the Bosphorus ripples gently under a soft breeze, and earth, sky, and water seem to sleep under the silvery rays of the moon. Rocked gently in your frail caique, at a little distance from the shore, you listen to the soft strains of music, coming over the water from the band on the Marina of Buyukdere, and catching distant glimpses under the lamps of the particoloured crowd, promenading up and down in front of the palatial residences overlooking the water. It is "a scene to dream of, not to tell" and a nearer view would dispel some of its enchantments, since the women generally are far from being pretty or attractive.
</p><p>One of the largest and finest palaces here is
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="182">182</span></h2>
<p>that of Abraham Pacha, an Armenian, whose history furnishes an illustration of the chances and changes of u Eastern life, still repeating the story of Aladdin. The father of this Armenian millionaire was a small saraff, or money-changer, at Stamboul, half a century ago. There came to him one day a young Arnaout, or Albanian officer, who had been ordered to Egypt then under Mameluke dominion by the Sultan. The young man wanted a small advance made on his pay, which the partner of the old saraff was disinclined to let him have. But Abraham Pacha's father was struck with the young man, and insisted on making the venture. The young soldier professed gratitude, and promised he would remember it, if the time should come when he could manifest it.
</p><p>When, under the well-known name of Mehemet Ali, he became master of Egypt, the saraff was sent for, and made his treasurer, and enriched exceedingly. His descendants continued in the favour of the family, and Abraham became finally
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="183">183</span></h2>
<p>the agent of Ismail Pacha at Constantinople, and had the handling of the enormous sums transmitted there, for various purposes, by that astute Prince. He was made Pacha, and enjoyed an enormous rent-roll. His gardens on the Bosphorus, near Beicos, constituting a small principality in that neighbourhood, are among the show places, and vie with those of the Sultan. Beyond Buyukdere there is a fine broad carriage road, shaded by trees, leading to the village and forest of Belgrade a charming drive of about six miles. The village is a small, tumble-down old place, whose unpainted and dilapidated houses present no attractive features to the visitor. The place has evidently seen better days, when it was the rival of Therapia and Buyukdere, as the summer resort of foreign diplomatists, and the crowd they ever attract around them here. But its glories have departed, and nobody thinks of visiting its neighbourhood for health or recreation now.&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="184">184</span></h2>
<p>Not having penetrated very far into the forest, I cannot pronounce an opinion as to its title to that sounding designation. It is almost twenty miles in extent. Great care is taken not to allow any of the trees to be cut down, which would cause the drying up of the springs which feed the great reservoirs supplying the aqueducts, which furnish water to Constantinople, fifteen miles distant. This&#160; great public work is due to the enlightened spirit of Sultan Mahmoud, who caused this great aqueduct to be built a century and a half ago; and it is his noblest and most enduring monument. The walled aqueduct, of nearly six hundred yards in length, and forty in breadth and with its twenty arches, so solidly built as to defy the touch of time constitutes a striking feature of the landscape.
</p><p>In this great public improvement the old Sultan, and some of his brethren, showed their capacity to adopt one of the most useful labours of the&#160; Byzantine Emperors, who devoted great&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="185">185</span></h2>
<p>pains and expense on their aqueducts, rendered indispensable by the peculiar character of the country immediately around their capital city. Water is an article in large demand, and profitable sale at Constantinople; and you see signs everywhere announcing depots of particular "brands," drawn from specially designated fountains. For a people not drinking wine, of course water is even a more constant necessary of life, than in those countries where the juice of the grape is substituted for the purer and healthier fluid. Aqueducts seem ever to have been the passion of the antique world the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, even the Turks, vying with each other, in their immense efforts to substitute an artificial for a natural supply of this indispensable agent of human health and comfort.
</p><p>The remains of the ancient baths, on a scale more colossal than any modern civilization can show, also prove that the external application of water was considered a greater want than it has been in later ages.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="186">186</span></h2>
<p>A cynical Roman writer has said, that " bread and the circus" supplied all the needs of his compatriots. He might justly have added water to his list; and as the Turk, unlike the Roman, drinks no wine, with him water is the article of prime necessity.
</p><p>Over the wastes of the Maremma, near Rome, still tower the ancient and ruined arches of the old aqueducts, which supplied the queen of the world with water, in the days of the Caesars. "Tarrying at Jericho," where not a stone of those walls, which fell at the blasts of Joshua's trumpets, nor trace of ancient habitation can be seen, by the pilgrim to that Scripturally historic site, the only testimony of its former grandeur is given by the ruins of the aqueducts which conveyed water to Jerusalem.
</p><p>But such a memorial of a Turkish Sultan one certainly would never have expected to see in the forest of Belgrade, especially since it is in perfect preservation, and practically useful, and comparing favourably with any similar work of the kind elsewhere.
