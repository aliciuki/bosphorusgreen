<p>The Aqueducts - The lover of nature, who is susceptibly of those sweet emotions which the sight of a beautiful country in fine weather inspires, can alone appreciate the difference between sensation and description. Let him, therefore, visit the delightful valley of Buyuk-Dere, the terrestrial Eden of the Turk, the theme and fairy scene of poetry; he will not view so rich a landscape without thrilling pleasure and gratitude for its divine artist.
</p><p>I shall attempt a faint outline. Buyuk-Dere is open to the south, exhibiting a spacious carpet of verdure, watered by the sea, which, seen in the foreground, affords an uninterrupted prospect. In the distance are seen the Bosphorus, the entrance of the canal into the Black Sea, all in motion with vessels under sail, and the mountainous coast of Asia. Numerous rivulets united in one channel, overshadowed with willows, refresh the sod, upon which a majestic clump of plantains extend afar their welcome shade, where repose the Turk, Greek, Arminian, and Frank, presenting the picture of concord as to religion, created by local influence, like brothers at enmity, who forget, in the presence of an affectionate mother, their differences, and are soothed by her persuasive tenderness into mutual peace.
</p><p>The hills which enclose the valley, gradually rise by gentle acclivities covered with the vine, and interspersed with pathways winding in every direction, which conduct to their summit. The prospect then embraces the Pont-Euxine and the Propontis; and at the same time vessels are seen upon different parts of the sea coming from Egypt and the Atlantic, while others are taking advantage of the same wind, making the ports of antient Tauride, or the mouths of the Nieper.
</p><p>The valley becomes narrower to the N. W. It is well cultivated, and the abundant produce of its gardens supplies the capital, and the village of Buyuk-Dere. Upon the hills, where the vine ends, the chestnut-tree begins, whose luxuriant branches shew that it is planted in a congenial soil. The sides of the valley are in part exposed to the storms, but the Italian poplar is seen elevating its waving head above the sturdy oak, the elm, and yoke-elm, which surround it. In the midst of the kitchen-gardens, watered by the numerous rivulets which descend from the hills, and under tufted nut-trees, are the humble cottages of numerous Greek families, living by toil under those proud Turks, who, lolling at their ease, smoking their pipes, behold with disdain the cultivation of the earth; while the former seem to have forgotten that their forefathers dictated laws upon that very soil now moistened with their sweat, and of whose produce they are too often despoiled.
</p><p>Long before arriving at the Aqueduct of Mahomet I. which crosses the valley, this monument is seen covered with large portions of ivy, which give it an air of antiquity, and this deception is the more easily imposed from the circumstance of nature here assuming her wildest aspect, reigning almost alone, and thus presenting a picture calculated to inspire sober contemplation, and give a zest to ruins.
</p><p>The narrow passage is channelled by the torrents, which in stormy weather rush down the rough declivities of the hills, covered to their summits with thickets, and deposit in the reservoir below, pieces of earth torn from the upper parts. Notwithstanding the richness of the scene, the imposing spectacle of the hydraulic work, characterized by its solidity, absorbs for a long time the attention. Supported by several arches, which rest upon perpendicular pillars strengthened by well-proportioned spurs, one should take it for a bold bridge, thrown over an impetuous river; and favoured by the surrounding solitude, it is with a secret emotion that one looks up to its majestic arches.
</p><p>Beyond this is the canal, which conveys a supply of water a mile and half off, into a reservoir, of the greatest magnificence, situated in a forest of chesnut-trees. The contiguous scenery and picturesque routes are altogether delightful and enchanting. This fine water, with that of another reservoir, is conducted to the suburbs of Galata and Pera, following a direction indicated by high pyramids, wherever the ground is low. Their purpose is to keep up the level&#160;; they are placed at distances calculated, upon the power of the waterâs ascent, so as to give it that same power, by means of cyphons which they enclose. The Turks, in general, shew much intelligence and skill in hydraulics, and spare no pains in obtaining knowledge from every quarter. They carry the water under-ground through pipes made of clay like bricks, to places where nature has refused a supply, surmounting every obstacle. Water is, therefore, met with throughout Turkey, in a kind of profusion which their religion explains, since it is the only beverage allowed by it, and, moreover, is indispensably necessary in their religious ceremonies,
</p><p>Near the Aqueduct is the village of Baktche-Keuiu, at the head of the valley of the same name, charmingly situated in a country capable of every production. Before entering it, a beautiful clump of pines extend their branches horizontally, forming a natural umbrella, which gives a singular character to the landscape. A profound solitude reigns in this second valley, rendered still more repulsive by the briars and thorns with which it is choaked up.
</p><p>The road from Baktche Keuiu to Belgrade, is as picturesque as it is possible for the imagination to conceive, winding through a mountainous country, buried under forests, which now and then discover openings displaying a pleasing contrast. It is a journey of three quarters of an hour to the line of division, and then Belgrade appears, whose situation is even superior to what has been described. It stands in a valley of the same name, upon a little rising ground; wherever you turn your eyes, you see mountains covered with forests, while round about you is an open country, studded with clumps of plantains and nut-trees. A rivulet bathes the foot of the heights, and, after losing itself, re-appears in the forest, where its waters are carefully collected, in a tank of fine workmanship, and are carried to Constantinople.
</p><p>The flower-season at Belgrade is that of pleasure, for the coolness of the situation attracts to it a great number of families from all nations, who go there to dissipate the noxious effluvia of winter by the balmy zephyrs of May. Etiquette is then banished, as if by a spontaneous effort, though not without some degree of regret, in exchange for liberty, her only asylum being here, but is consoled in reserving for herself Buyuk-Dere, where she reigns the tyrant as much as in Pera her capital. But this pleasure is fugitive, as the summer-beats, rendering Belgrade unhealthy by the moist exhalations, drive back to Buyuk-Dere that crowd of slaves, who, besides, soon regret their fetters, and resume them with as much pride as complaisance. The harvest-season is not less delightful than that of flowers. Young Greek maids, whose black hair floats in long tresses upon their shoulders, then adorn, as on holidays, their heads with brilliant poppies, (paoots) intertwined with yellow epis (corn-ears) and blue-bottles.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="16-20">16-20</span></h2>
<p>The road from Belgrade to the reservoir, which deserves the particular attention of the connoisseur as a work of art, lies to the west in descending the valley; under the thick foliage of the chestnut and the oak, and along the side of the artificial lake, formed by the waters of the stream, by means of the tank, which give rise to a pleasing illusion; followed by delight, at the magical aspect which nature assumes in this her retreat; here she no longer, like a timid beauty, conceal herself from the importunity of her lovers. The chain of heights upon the left arrests the waters at the bottom, by a rough acclivity, covered with shrubs. The contrast of their light, with the dark green of the sturdy oak, and the weeping-willow leaning over the margin of the lake, which reflects its foliage, has altogether a pleasing effect.
</p><p>The basin, at its extremity, becomes very narrow, and is closed up by the tank, which is a formidable piece of marble masonry, well designed and constructed for its object. The waters, thus arrested in their course, are turned into a subterraneous canal, which takes a direction across the forest. The overplus is taken off by a flood-gate, in the middle of the reservoir. Farther on, in another solitude, equally delightful, is a junction-basin, where the waters meet from two channels and reservoirs. From this basin they are conducted in a canal to Constantinople. A mile off is repeated, with some trifling differences, the picturesque scenery of the aqueduct of Baktche-Keuiu. Here is another aqueduct, the work of Mustapha III. It takes the waters of a stream to the right, and conducts them to their junction with that of Belgrade.
</p><p>After leaving this second aqueduct, the country and cultivated fields appear; the latter divided by hedges, planted with young oaks. A gentle acclivity brings the traveller to a point from which there is a prospect of the country, broken into small hills and bogs, which terminate in the valley of Pirgos, seen in a parallel direction about a mile and a half off.
</p><p>The next objects are three aqueducts, the most striking of which is to the north, and crosses the valley of Pirgos, above the village of that name, supported by two stories, of fifty arches each. Sultan Solyman was the restorer of this beautiful work, which bears the waters of a stream running from the south-east, and conveys them to the aqueduct of Justinian, which receives all; and they then proceed, in one common canal, to Constantinople. The second aqueduct, in point of merit, likewise crosses the valley of Pirgos, but under the village, rising majestically upon three strong distributed oval arches, into the shape of an elbow, to correspond with the adjacent bank. It receives the waters of the valley of Belgrade, ‘likewise those of the second aqueduct, and sends, by subterraneous canals, its tribute to that of Justinian, joining, during its course, the waters of the aqueduct of Solyman, in one common basin, situated upon the spur between the valleys of Pirgos and Ali-Bey-Keuiu.
</p><p>The third erection of this kind is to the south-west. It carries the waters of the valley of Belgrade, likewise those of the aqueduct of Mustapha, from the right bank to that opposite, from whence they run into the elbow-aqueduct. It is shorter and lower than the latter, which is also less than that of Solyman. The aqueduct of Justinian is superior to all for the boldness and elegance of its design and construction, and it is only to be regretted that the architect preferred the triangular to the more elegant oval arch, for which the ancients shewed so marked a predilection. It is manifest, therefore, that taste had undergone some sensible changes when this work was erected; but, on the other hand, the state of preservation and pertinacity in which its materials are found, evince that the art of building had lost nothing in point of solidity.
</p><p>We now come to the destination of the waters which we have left in the aqueduct of Justinian. They take a course to the right bank of the valley of Cydaris, descending it about half-way, crossing, by hydraulic-works, the contiguous ones, and gathering, in their progress, the waters which have their source in the same chain of hills; at length they are brought to the gate Egri-Capou, and deposited in a basin, from whence they are distributed over the capital.
</p><p>The woods which cover the heights, and a great part of the basin of Belgrade, and all the valleys which provide the reservoirs and aqueduct, are considered with respect, and perish only from age or tempests. They are never demolished, unless by authority. They are invaluable, furnishing by the clouds, which they attract and impregnate, the sources of supply to the capital, and which would otherwise dry up at a time of the year when most wanted. The hydraulic-works are not, however, so well kept up as they ought to be, and a quantity of the water, collected at a great expense, is lost; a great quantity, however, is on the way to its destination, but the different canals having numerous branches, which receive a portion of their tribute, they become almost exhausted ere they reach the basin.
</p><p>To go to Pirgos, there is another road from the aqueduct of Baktche-Keuiu, keeping the left of the valley, and leading into that of Belgrade, through the thickest part of the forest. It is here, surely, timid nymphs may throw aside their dress, to plunge into the stream, invited and emboldened by the profound solitude, the clearness of the water, the coolness of the shade, and other captivating charms. They would have nought to fear but the sage, who, fleeing from the ingratitude of man, seeks an asylum from nature; or the disappointed lover, throwing himself into the arms of this consoling mother; or the hind and light-footed fawn; but the sight of such harmless beings would soon dispel their alarm.
</p><p>The road follows the borders of the torrent, supplied by the waters of many rivers, and running upon a rocky bed, through slender oaks, which conceal the country by their shade. You pursue your route with uncertainty as to where it will lead you, and yet are beguiled by an inexpressible charm arising from it. If you raise your voice, echo alone answers you. Creeping and bulbous plants, the ivy, &amp;c. are everywhere seen. Already the world, and its vanities, are forgotten; you think no more of that earth which in infancy you have left; and, seduced by imagination, you touch the precincts of elysium, until the envious light dispels your fond dream, and disagreeably undeceives you. You resume your route to Pirgos, which, having reached, another species of voluptuous scenery cousoles you for what you have lost. A spacious valley, of some miles in extent, exhibits a high degree of cultivation; meadows on which spring has lavished her flowers; fields of ripening corn; orchards laden with fruit; vineyards crowning the little hills, clustered with the juicy grape; gardens full of produce; at the bottom of the valley, the Barbyses winding its course under the shade of the alder and the willow; upon one of the rising grounds, the village of Pirgos, whose numerous houses, promiscuously built, add to the picturesque of the landscape. On the opposite side are seen forests, whose wild appearance throw a contrast into the picture, and, at the extremities are two aqueducts, which are as frame-work to it. Beyond this, cultivation is more neglected, and shortly ceases altogether on quitting the valley, where there is a Turkish village; but this dismal scene is so common in Turkey, that one feels more sensibly the pleasure arising from the sight of abundant crops, than regret at meeting with sterile heaths.
</p><p>After crossing the valley, the road from Pirgos to the aqueduct of Justinian leads you again through the forests, and a desert restored to all her rights, near this erection. The birds of prey which soar over your head, the grass which dries under your feet, the waters which wash the bottom of the winding basin, supplied by the Cydaris, are so many proofs of these places being little frequented, and not free from danger. To meet with habitations, you must penetrate the lateral valleys, amongst which Dgebedge-Keuiu holds the first rank for extent and cultivation. On entering it, the many cart-ruts bespeak a numerous population, and about a mile from the aqueduct stands a Greek village, pleasantly situated, and whose exterior announces the ease and comfort of its inhabitants.
</p><p>All, however, that the traveller may expect isâfire, water, the cooling shade, and the frugal meal: but this suffices the lover of nature, who is not afraid of multiplying his points of contact with her. And, besides this, his route is perfumed with flowers in the spring, which deck the meadows; his sight is regaled by the yellow ears of corn, cradled by the breeze; and if he associate with the lore of rural scenery, that of the arts in harmony with if, he beholds, with satisfaction, the numerous bydraulic-works which fill the valley, and recal to mind the primaeval state of the Ottoman empire; then, notwithstanding his fatigue, he thanks his guide for having conducted him through the desert to this other temple of Jupiter-Ammon.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="20">20</span></h2>
<p>Note - Dionysius of Byzantium calls the valley of Buyuk-Dere kalos agros, the good field. According to Tournefort, the deep gulf upon which it opens was called Saronica, on account of an altar having been raised to Saron, the hero or sea-god of Megara.
</p><p>The aqueduct above Pirgos, or Bourgas, has two stories of arches, fifty in each story. They are fifteen feet wide, and the square pillar the same, so that with the two binders which connect the aqueduct with the high ground on each side, its length may be estimated at two hundred and seventy toises, or yards. Its height is twenty-six yards two feet. It is not so elegant as that of Justinian, and docs not promise so permanent a duration as the ancient ones. It is easy to recognize, in the application of the materials, the hand of the Turk who built, or rather rebuilt it That commonly known by the name of Constantine may, indeed, have been constructed in his reign; or, rather, to judge from its elliptic arches, it might date its origin from a period anterior to the Goths, changing the form of Roman architecture. Some, however, attribute it to the Emperor Adronicus, and thus conclude from the hydraulic-works which he had executed,-a proof too weak to decide the question.
</p><p>Each of its three stories is distributed into arches fifteen feet wide, resting upon square pillars fifteen feet thick. The first story has thirty-three, the second twelve, and the level four. A gallery extends the length of the first story, and is about three hundred and forty feet.
</p><p>The aqueduct of Justinian is of two stories, each distributed into four great arches of forty-two feet wide, resting upon square pillars of sixty-four feet. The first story has, moreover, at each end, four arches of twelve feet wide. A gallery, worked out of the square pillars, extends the length of the first story, which is descended by two flights of fifteen steps each. In the square pillars are niches to admit the light, which, by lessening the bulk of the masonry, makes the edifice appear not so heavy. They are strengthened by shelving spurs, rounded in the middle, going from the first story to their root, so as to form a frame-work along the niches, and which at the same time that they contribute powerfully by their patten-surface to the solidity of the work, shew to more advantage the boldness of the detached arches which support it. The length of the gallery is one hundred and sixty toises, or yards, and the freight about one hundred and forty feet.
