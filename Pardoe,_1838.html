<p>Aqueduct Near Pyrgo
</p><p>" Relic of nobler days, and noblest arts." Byron.
</p><p>This fine remain of by-gone industry and taste is indifferently ascribed to the Emperor Valens, and to Justinian; no positive record of its date or founder being now in existence. It spans a lovely hill-embosomed valley near Pyrgo, and is one of several aqueducts still in existence between the city of Constantinople, and the beautiful, romantic, and Frank-peopled hamlet of Belgrade, on the Black Sea.
</p><p>The necessity of an ample supply of water to a population of nearly eight hundred thousand souls, and the frequency of drought in the capital, have led to great care and some ingenuity in its conveyance to the cisterns and reservoirs of the city from the numerous streams that fall from the mountains which fence the Euxine, and the rivulets that irrigate the valleys among them. Every rill, however apparently trifling, is arrested in its progress, when it descends from a height into the lower lands; by which means the valleys become inundated, and form deep and extensive lakes, whence the water is conveyed in tile pipes along the mountains, to pour its volume into the aqueducts which span the valleys, and give a noble character to the wild landscape. These artificial reservoirs are called bendts, and were originally formed by the Greeks; and the dams by which they are shut in are mounds, faced with marble, sculptured in oriental devices and characters, which are extremely imposing, and even magnificent. The Turks are, however, suffering the aqueducts of their predecessors to fall slowly to decay; and have supplied their places by detached square hydraulic pillars, sufficiently ingenious in their construction to merit description. A small reservoir is on the summit of each; and tubes, similar to those laid along the heights, pour the water into this tank on one side, and discharge it on the other.
</p><p>Each pillar is six inches lower than that which preceded it; and thus a gradual descent is produced along the tops of these suy-terrasi, or columns, from the mountains to Stamboul; and as they are spread in considerable numbers over the country, the supply is generally abundant, though it sometimes fails when the season is unusually dry, as in the years 1822 and 1836.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="25">25</span></h2>
<p>At such periods, the terror of a people like the Osmanlis, who not only connect ideas of comfort and convenience with the pure element, but to whom it is essential in the offices of their religion, may be readily conceived&#160;; and not the least affecting"' of its demonstrations is the appearance of a Dervish on the crest of the Jouchi-Daghi, or Giant's Mountain, whose duty it is to watch for, and to announce to the thirsting city, the anxiously-awaited appearance of a small, lowering, heavy cloud, hovering above the waves of Marmora, or the Euxine—a certain indication of coming rain, which causes the Christian soujourner in the East to revert at once to the Sacred Volume, whose holy truths are constantly recalled to his memory in the land of the Infidel. The artist seized a happy moment in which to transfer to his sketch-book the Aqueduct of Pyrgo. The sunshine rested lovingly on the old grey stones of the stupendous pile at one extremity, while the cool shadows of the mountain, with its flowery mantle of cistus, caper plants, and wild vines, were flung in soft contrast over the other. A party of travellers, with their serudjhes* sumpter mules, and araba drawn by buffaloes, were about to halt for their mid-day meal; and the sounds of human life and human laughter joyously awoke the echoes of the arch-spanned valley.
</p><p>Nature and art, the present and the past, were before him; and the result has been not only a faithful, but a strikingly characteristic sketch.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="96-100">96-100</span></h2>
<p>A Bendt in the Forest of Belgrade
“A lovely spot, half sunshine, and half shade.
Where flickering boughs a shifting picture made;
And tranquil waters, 'mid the general hush,
Gazed on the sun until they stole his blush!”
</p><p>The village of Belgrade, formerly called Beil Gorod, (a word signifying, in the Sclavonian language, White Fortress) is situated at the termination of the Great Bendt, or Reservoir, which forms the subject of the accompanying sketch.
</p><p>Nothing can exceed in beauty the situation of this mountain-hamlet, nestled in a green valley bright with turf and flowers, and traversed by a sparkling stream, which, after winding gracefully for two or three miles through the plain, finally empties itself into the Bendt. The heights by which the valley is encompassed are a portion of the chain of the Lower Balcan, and are, in this immediate neighbourhood, richly clothed with stately forests of chestnut, maple, oak, and other noble timber; while the glen itself is studded with groups of beech-trees, whose soft and fantastic outlines cut gracefully against the sunny sky, and whose flexile and leafy branches throw their long and refreshing shadows across the grass, and the dancing ripple of the pigmy river.
</p><p>But Belgrade, beautiful as it undoubtedly is, is nevertheless much changed since the year 1717, when the talented Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, courting its shades in the sultry month of June, thus wrote to the immortal bard of Twickenham.
</p><p>"The heats of Constantinople have driven me to this place, which perfectly answers the description of the Elysian fields. I am in the middle of a wood, consisting chiefly of fruit-trees, watered by a vast number of fountains famous for the excellency of their water, and divided into many shady walks, upon short grass, that seems to me artificial, but, I am assured, is the pure work of nature, and within view of the Black Sea, from whence we perpetually enjoy the refreshment of cool breezes, that make us insensible of the heat of the summer.
</p><p>The village is only inhabited by the richest amongst the Christians, who meet every night at a fountain, forty paces from my house, to sing and dance. The beauty and dress of the women exactly resemble the ideas of the ancient nymphs, as they are given us by the representations of the poets and painters."*
</p><p>When the fair and gifted Ambassadress sketched this beautiful picture of the spot, she must have been, as she herself expresses it, "in the middle of a wood;" for, until the summer of 19823, the Valley of Belgrade was rich in chestnut, beech, oak, walnut, lime-trees, plantains, and every description of forest timber; but, unfortunately for the lover of "the gay green wood," the recesses of Belgrade became at that period the retreat of parties of the scattered Janissaries, who had escaped during the massacre; and who, carrying along with them all the surviving rabble of the city who had espoused their cause, and sided with them during the carnage, divided themselves between the forest of Belgrade and the heights of Moudania; the more active passing over into Asia Minor, and infesting the mountains as far as Broussa&#160;; and the less far-seeing, concealing themselves in the dense woods bordering the Black Sea. Here the wretched men subsisted for a time on fruits and herbs; but, despairing of brighter fortune, they soon became desperate, and sallying forth upon every chance traveller, in parties of eight or ten, as they had associated themselves, they constantly robbed, and occasionally murdered, until the roads were considered to be impassable. Various, and even strenuous efforts were made by the government to capture or disperse them, but as they amounted to some hundreds, they set at defiance both the soldiery and the police; and although an occasional straggler was captured by the troops, summarily strangled, and his body flung by the wayside for the purpose of terrifying his comrades into submission, no effect was produced; until the Sultan, irritated and wearied by their prolonged enormities, decided on setting fire to the forest, and thus destroying their stronghold. This expedient was accordingly adopted; the woods were ignited in several directions, and a military cordon established on the heights, with strict orders to fire upon every individual who attempted to escape. Could the mind have been freed from the consciousness that the fierce flames were serving as the ministers of a painful and relentless death, the scene would have been surpassingly magnificent!
</p><p>The primeval forest which had stood tall and dark upon the earth in solemn grandeur for centuries, challenging the antiquity of the hoary heights beyond, and excluding from its mysterious depths the brightness of the stars; defying the glorious day-beam which failed to penetrate its wild recesses, and concealing amid its trackless wilderness a thousand things of life, became suddenly girdled with fire—the tall trees shivered, crackled, swayed, leant towards each other as the tongues of flame bound them in one apparently solid mass—stood out for an instant, charred and leafless against the sky, as the scared ocean-wind struggled for a brief interval with its rival element—and then fell with a crash that woke the caverned echoes of Asia, while the leaping waves that chafed against the bleak Symplegades, caught the deep tint, and turned the sea to gold&#160;; and the majestic aqueduct of Baghtche-keui, above the valley, lost for a time its snowy tint, and seemed to be formed of sculptured ore.
</p><p>The ruin wrought bravely. Belgrade was girt with fire; the flames extended for several square miles, and ere many hours elapsed, all was desolation; while, (meet accompaniment for such a scene&#160;!) the constant report of musquetry was blent with the shrieks of human agony, and the deep groan of human suffering filled up the horrid diapason. Of all who had been sheltered by the forest of Belgrade, it was believed that not one escaped with life. Most of the fugitives fell beneath the bullets of the soldiery; while a few, strong and stern even in extremity, disdained to fly merely to exchange a death of suffering for a prompter end at the hands of their exulting victors; and thus they perished in their silent fortitude, with the forest-trees amid which they had been so long hidden.
</p><p>The Bendts, or Tanks, are of classic origin, having been formed by the Greek Emperors when Byzantium became a second Rome, and the necessities of an increasing population rendered it imperative on their rulers to secure to the growing city a sure and sufficient supply of water. They were constructed with considerable ingenuity, extreme care, and great cost; and their preservation was anxiously insured by repeated edicts, several of which are still in the Imperial Library of the Eski Serai, insisting strongly upon their immense utility, regulating the planting of the trees by which they were to be surrounded, and prohibiting, under pain of the Imperial displeasure, and a heavy fine, the abstraction of water by any individual whomsoever; every such offender being compelled, upon detection, to pay a pound of gold for each ounce weight of water.
</p><p>All the rills which trickle through the valley have been directed to one point, and now unite in a stream of considerable volume, which flows between two hills, and finally empties itself into the Great Bendt; while, in every instance where a similar arrangement is feasible in this region of springs and moisture, another of these mountain-reservoirs, smaller in size, but equally perfect in construction, will repay the search of the traveller.
</p><p>The Suy-Terrasi, by whose means the water is now conveyed on a summit level, were described earlier in the work; and their effect, scattered for miles over the face of the country, from the Black Sea to Pera, is extremely singular, setting all the conjectures of the uninitiated at defiance. These were invented at a later period by the Turks themselves, in order to avoid the enormous outlay necessary to the erection of Aqueducts; but they were not allowed, nevertheless, to supersede them altogether—a fact which must gratify every lover of the picturesque, as he gazes on the majestic Aqueduct of Valide, which is flung across the fair valley of Buyuk-dere, terminating the vista as seen from the Bosphorus, and linking the heights with a range of snowy arches.
</p><p>Another, of more vast, but, perhaps, less graceful proportions, and certainly less happily situated, is that of Solyman, near Pyrgo, of which a sketch has been already given. It dominates a valley one thousand six hundred feet in width, is formed by a double range of fifty arches, and is of very imposing appearance, and constructed with great solidity.
</p><p>The Aqueduct of Valens is one of the most striking objects that meets the eye of the stranger, as he gazes enraptured on the far-famed city of the Bosphorus. Dark, and hoar, and massy, it links two of the seven hills, and spans the peopled valley with a giant grasp; in strong contrast to the gaiety and glitter of the marble mosques, and party-coloured houses. Festoons of the graceful wild-vine, and the scented honeysuckle, drapery its mouldering masonry; masses of the caper-plant, with its beautiful blossoms, conceal the ravages of time; lichens trail among its arches; and a variety of stone plants, fed by the moisture which is continually oozing through the interstices of the building, flourish in picturesque luxuriance, and lend a glory to its decay. Historians allude to several other Aqueducts, which they assert to have had existence in Constantinople, but no trace now remains within the walls of the city of any, save this; and its origin is thus curiously accounted for by a modem traveller.
</p><p>“The Emperor, incensed at the conduct of the people of Chalcedon, who had favoured the party of Procopius, ordered their walls to be pulled down. Among the stones was found one with an oracular inscription, implying that ‘ the walls of Chalcedon would bring a great supply of water to the city;’ and, to complete the prophecy, Valens erected his Aqueduct with the materials.”
</p><p>It is impossible to calculate how often this venerable ruin must have overlooked a scene of flame and terror; in 1836, the streets by which it is surrounded were levelled by an extensive conflagration, that lit up the sky of midnight with a wild and lurid gleam, and turned the ripple of the channel into liquid metal. Every object within the harbour was as visible as at noonday, but wore a spectral brightness never to be forgotten by those who witnessed the grand and imposing spectacle; the dark hulls of the shipping seemed to float upon a sea of molten lead, while the delicate tracery of the cordage appeared to be hanging in links of gold from mast to mast. The dome of St. Sophia glowed like a huge carbuncle; and the slender minarets stood out like silver wands from an atmosphere of brass; while the rigid cypresses, whose dense foliage flung back the unnatural brightness as if in mockery, loomed darkly on the eye like the presiding forms of destroying demons overlooking their work of devastation.
</p><p>Amid all this ruin, the Aqueduct of Yalens remained unscathed. Some portions of its leafy coronal, parched by the intense heat, hung on the morrow, scorched and blighted; but the hoary remnant of by-gone centuries still soared proudly above the prostrate city at its feet, and received as incense the smoke of its destruction.
</p><p>No single inscription can now be traced on any portion of the work; not a lettered stone has ever repaid the search of the curious, or rewarded the labour of the antiquary; and the tradition cited by Dr. Walsh is said to be the only record of its date, or of its founder. To the picturesque traveller, the Aqueduct of Yalens will, however, require no historical interest to lend it value; as of all the antiquities of Constantinople, none form so prominent a feature in the landscape, or tend so greatly to contrast their classic and graceful shadowing with the broad lights and vivid colouring of the remainder of the picture.
</p><p>Many others exist without the city, but all more or less in a state of decay the Turks, by an unaccountable fatality, neglecting their aqueducts and cisterns, while they are rigorously strict on the subject of the Bendts; planting the embankments; and condemning to severe penalties, not only the "drawers of water," but also the "hewers of wood," who may be rash enough to exercise their vocation within the guarded precincts.
