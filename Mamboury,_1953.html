<p><b>AQUEDUCTS</b>
</p><p>The question of drinking water has ever been one of the major problems of the cities of antiquity. Byzantium, especially exposed to the danger of numerous sieges, organised its water supply in a remarkable manner. Apart from the fact that every house had its own tank for keeping rain water, the emperors created a system of supply of spring water that was extended and improved by the sultans. For that reason the town possesses a number of ancient cisterns and reservoirs while the neighbourhood still has its famous aqueducts and bends, or great reservoirs.
</p><p>The greater part of the water comes from the Forest of Belgrad, a wide area once covered with oak forest and tolerably well wooded even to-day. But the best source of water is in the hills which form the watershed between the Golden Horn and the Marmara.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="193">193</span></h2>
<p>The Asiatic side of the Bosphorus and Marmara draw their supply form the bend of Göksu, in the valley to the east of Anadoluhisarı.
</p><p>In the reign of Abdul Hamit II the spring known as Hamidiye was captured and piped to the valley of Kağıthane, at the close of the last century.
</p><p>The modern water supply of Istanbul is the lake of Terkos or Derkos, about twenty-five miles to the north west of the city. In 1951 the installation was completed of two lines of cast iron pipes one meter on diameter, so that the old problem of supplying Istanbul with adequate quantities of water is now solved.
</p><p><b>HISTORICAL</b>
</p><p>...
In 382 there was a grave shortage of water, which was rationed. This forced Theodosius I to pay attention to the problem. He made a new line which ended in town in the Valens aqueduct, to feed which he built an aqueduct, finished in 396, in the Forest of Belgrad, but we do not know which it
was. Between 439 and 441 Theodosius II reserved the waters brought by the Valens aqueduct for the Nymphaeum, the official bath and the palaces. Valentinian an Marcian, in 451, issued a law for the repair of the water pipe lines. Justinian did not always maintain them and in 543 he even destroyed one because it was made of lead and he required that metal for one his statutes.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="194">194</span></h2>
<p>However he had the Valens aqueduct repaired and led its waters to the cistern of the basilika of Jelus, which Strzygowski has identified with the cistern of Binbirdirek. In 576 Justin II installed two separate line of pipes in the Valens aqueduct.
</p><p>In the eight century the Avars destroyed the water mains outside the city. It was Constantine V Copronymus in 758 who, owing to the water shortage, had them restored and repaired. For further repairs we have to wait for Michael IV, in 1034, when the lines were cleaned. Manuel I Comnenus (1143-1180) had the mains cleaned too and, further, he had an underground reservoir dug at Petra, fed directly by several springs and numerous drains that he dug. This reservoir, in the form of a circular basin, was identified by Hammer with the bashavus, or principal cistern, of Sultan Osman II, near Kemerburgaz (Pyrgos), but it is not absolutely certain, for it must have been nearer the town. Andronicus I Comnenus (1183-1185) had Hadrian's canals repaired, captured the water of Hydralis (Pasaderesi) and brought it to Blachernae and to the market place. According to Hammer the bashavus of Osman II was
originally built by that sultan.
</p><p>Andronicus I seems to have been the last Byzantine emperor paid any attention to the question of water supply. The Latins undertook no repairs. We must remember that at the
time of the Ottoman conquest the population of the city hardly more than 40-50.000 inhabitants, and so the existing water supply was adequate.
</p><p>But the sultans rapidly re-populated the city and a shortage of water was soon felt, so that they were obliged to overhaul the supply. Fatih began by repairing the old main pipe which passed by the aqueduct of Valens, which drew its water from the region of Halkali (Marmara) to supply his palace, that is the old palace on Bayezit Place, the baths and the quarter of Kirkceşme. Bayezit II added a new line for his mosque and
bath. The earthquake of 1509 having damaged the aqueducts, they were restored. In 1548 Süleyman the Magnificent enlarged the Halkali line to feed his mosque of Şehzade and he ordered Sinan to build the aqueduct of Müderisköyü.&#160;
</p><p>Pierre Gylles, who was in Istanbul in 1542-1550 and was very well informed about everything, also studied the question of the water supply. We followed up the stream Barbyses, which the Greeks at the time called Khartarion and the Ottomans Kağıthanesuyu, as far as its two affluants, the Ayvatderesi and the Paşaderesi, the ancient Hydralis of Andronicus I Comnenus. He saw only the aqueduct of Eğrikemer (previously Kemerburgaz), for the others did not yet exist. He also went up the valley of the Kydaris, the present Alibeysuyu, as far as an aqueduct which must have occupied the position of the present aqueduct of Maglova and must have been Byzantine.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="195">195</span></h2>
<p>It is called the aqueduct of Justinian, but that must be a modern appellation.
</p><p>Süleyman the Legislator began the great main pipe line of Kirkceşme in 1554, to bring water from the Forest of Belgrad. Hunting one day in the valley of of Kağıthane he came across
the remains of an old aqueduct, no doubt that of Andronicus I, the present Eğrikemer, and decided to have it repaired. According to the Ottoman writer Selaniki the engineer in charge was a Greek, Kiris Nikolas, but the Ottoman writer Sayı states that it was the Court architect Sinan who did the work. In fact Sinan countersigned or constructed fifteen aqueducts,
large and small, of which the most important are Bendkemeri — not yet identiﬁed —, Uzunkemer, the Maglovakemeri, called the aqueduct of Justinian, the Güzelcekemer. On 20th September 1563 a great storm destroyed the Maglovakemeri and the Uzunkemer, which Sinan rebuilt, finishing the work in 1564.
</p><p>With regard to the forty fountains attributed to Süleyman I, we must understand in that name not the number forty, but the district of Forty Fountains, Kırkҫeşme in Turkish; near the base of the Valens aqueduct, towards the Golden Horn, which was fed by the water from the aqueduct. Süleyman supplied this quarter with water from the Forest of Belgrad and it was at that epoch that the quarter and the fountain,
which no longer existed, took the name of Kırkҫeşme.
</p><p>The Sultan Osman II (1618-1622) either restored or had built the başhavuz or main reservoir of Kemerburgaz. Under Mehmet IV (1648-1687), in 1672, the Grand Vezir Mehmet
Köprülü, or else his son Fazil Ahmet Paşa, had a new line built that bears his name. In 1675 a pipe line was installed near the Bedesten. Mustafa II (1695-1703) had substantial repairs done on the Valens aqueduct in 1696-97, as shewn by the inscription which is still in place. Ahmet III (1705-1730) in 1708 restored the whole of the aqueduct of Halkali: in 1722 he
built seven new bends or reservoirs, five near Cebeci, in the Valley of Fatih, one in the valley of Topuzlu, near Belgrad, and another near Ҫiftehavuz. Mustafa III built the Ayvatbendi in
1766 and Mahmut I (1730-1754) in 1732 built the Bahҫeköy line, which collects the water from the three bends of Mahmut I, of the Validé and of Topuzlu, taking the waters from the two valleys of Belgrad and Balban and brings them through the aqueduct of Bahҫeköy, with the help of several suterazi, to Şişli and Beyoğlu.
</p><p>Since those days the water supply and mains were neglected and fell into disrepair. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the water of lake Terkos was brought to the town, with sufficient pressure to provide water to all the houses as well as the municipal services, though subject to frequent more or less local interruptions. In 1896 the Sultan Abdul Hamit II&#160; captured the waters called the Hamidiye, a drinking water, which feeds a number of fountains in the town.&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="196">196</span></h2>
<p>To complete the picture, we must add that the Asiatic suburbs are fed from the bend of Göksu, to the east of Anadoluhisarı, and it is probable that before long the waters of the Taşdelen Spring - one of the best in the region - in the forest of Alemdağ,
will be brought by a new main to Üsküdar.
</p><p>To-day the water supply is managed by the Municipality, but until the beginning of the century all supplies had a double object, religious and imperial, whether by sultans or by private
persons, and the administration was in the hands of the Evkaf, the Establishment of Pious Foundations.
</p><p><b>THE SYSTEM</b>
</p><p>The aqueduct and the bends are distributed over three basins or zones:
</p><p>(1) the Mahmut I (1732) line, along the Bosphorus. It comprises three bends, Mahmutbendi, Validébendi and Topuzlubend and an aqueduct, that of Sultan Mahmut, called the aqueduct of Bahҫeköy. It supplies water to the European shore of the Bosporus and to Beyoğlu and Galata.
</p><p>(2) the Kırkҫeşme line, also called the Belgrad line, which collects the water from the two streams of Kağıthane and Alibey. It is formed by two branches. The first receives the water of Karanlikbendi and Büyükbend, which meet in the
Ҫiftehavuz with the waters of Kirazlibend. The line then passes over the Crooked Aqueduct (Eğrikemer), also called the Kovukkemer and reaches the başhavuz of Osman II. There it
mingles with the water which crosses the valley of Kağıthane below the Long Aqueduct (Uzunkemer). The two mains, now connected, cross the valley of the Alibey by the Maglova aqueduct or Muallakkemeri, then the valley of Cebeci on the aqueduct called Güzelce, and then collects the waters from the five bends of Ahmet III. All the latter part is with little aqueducts. Finally, the main reaches the taksim or distribution point of Eğrikapı
at a height of 35 metres. It is the most important
line of the Istanbul supply, bringing about 12600 cubic metres of water a day, and its water flows in a cubic pipe. Further, it passes on its line some of the finest works of Sinan. From the taksim of Eğrikapı one branch goes to Kırkҫeşme and to the taksim of Ayasofya, the other to the taksim of Narlıkapı on the Marmara.
</p><p>...
</p><p>THE AQUEDUCTS (The Aqueduct of Bahҫeköy or of Sultan Mahmut, Sultan Mahmut Kemeri).
</p><p>Constructed one kilometre south of the village of Bahҫeköy on the Büyükdere side. It consists of a single series of Gothic arches. Length 409 metres, 450 yards: height 27 m., 120 ft. It brings water of the three bends of Mahmut, Validé and Topuzlu to the taksim at Şişli and Beyoğlu. It is a remarkable piece of work, by Sultan Mahmut I, completed in 1732.
</p><p>AQUEDUCT OF CEBECiKÖY
</p><p>Also in Turkish Cebeciköyü or Güzelce Kemeri.
</p><p>Seven kilometres south of Kemerburgaz and 1500 m., about a mile, to the east of the village of Cebeci, it is part of the system of Kırkҫeşme. Built by Sinan in th reign of Süleyman the Lawgiver, 1563-64, on an affluent of the stream Alibey, it
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="199">199</span></h2>
<p>consists of two rows of arches, eight in the lower, eleven in the upper row: the pillars are armed with spurs pointing to the west: the length is 170 metres, the height 32 m.
</p><p>AQUEDUCT OF JUSTINIAN (Maglova kemeri)
</p><p>Built across the valley of the Alibey, the ancient Kydaris, 5 kms south. west of Kemerburgaz: composed of four main
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="200">200</span></h2>
<p>arches in the middle portion, on two rows, at each end with small arches: the lower arches have an operture of 18 m, 40, and upper of 13 m 40: the five main pillars of 12 m. of front have buttresses and are pierced by three little arches superposed, which lighten the construction and give it at the same time a picturesque appearance. The length is 265 m, and height 35 m. It takes the water from the Elbowed or Crooked Aqueduct, (Eğrikemer or Kovukkemeri) and the Uzunkemeri, which are first mingled in the başhavuz or main reservoir of Kemerburgaz. It is known as the aqueduct of Justinian but its proper name is Maglova kemeri. It belongs to the Kırkҫeşme system and was built by Sinan under Süleyman the Legislator in 1563-64. On 20th September 1563 a violent storm partly destroyed it before building was completed. It was immediately re-built and completed in 1564. It is probably on the site of an older Byzantine aqueduct of unknown name, the ruins of which were seen by Pierre Gylles between 1452 and 1550. He attributes it to the Emperor Andronicus I Comnenus (1183-1185), but Nicetas Khoniates who wrote in the thirteenth century, said that that emperor only repaired it.
</p><p>UZUNKEMER, THE LONG AQUEDUCT
</p><p>Situated about a mile to the north west of the village of Kemerburgaz: built in two rows with apertures of 48 and 50 metres respectively: 716 m in length and 26 m. high. Begun in 1563 b Sinan under Süleyman I, it was also destroyed in the tempest of 20th September of the same year, and at once rebuilt, being finished in 1564. It brings water to the Ayvat bendi from the Forest of Belgrad to Ayasofya by the başhavuz or reservoir of Kemerburgaz and belongs to the Kırkҫeşme system.&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="201">201</span></h2>
<p>MAZLUM KEMERI
</p><p>About 21/2 miles to the north east of the village of Mahmudiye, the old Kalfaköyü: 104 m. long and 13.85 high and 13.85 high and 4 m. 65 wide: it consists of a series of eleven double stage arches, built in limestone blocks: it is 80 m. above sea. level, that is 16 m. 50 higher than the Valens aqueduct. It was built by Valens in 368, destroyed by the Avars and rebuilt by Constantine V Copronymos about 758. It belongs therefore to the group of the oldest Byzantine aqueducts and to the ﬁrst great system of Valens.
</p><p>CROOKED, or ELBOWED AQUEDUCT, EĞRİKEMER or KOVUKKEMERİ
</p><p>Built over the old Barbyzes, the stream of Kağıthane, across the valley of Kemerburgaz, a mile to the south east of that village. It consists of two segments of 126 and 216 metres, forming an obtuse angle. The greater portion strides the valley in three rows of arches, with four apertures below, ten in the middle and 21 above, directly supported. It is 35 m. high, 6 m 50 wide at the base and 3 m 50 at the top, thus having a pyramidal cross section which is attractive: the 126 m section built on the upper slope of the hill, has a row of 12 arches. It brings the water of the great bend of the Forest of Belgrad by the reservoir of Kemerburgaz as fair as the taksim of Ayasofya. It was formerly known as the Aqueduct of Constantine, but
it seems to have been built by Andronicus I Comnenus (1183-1185). Between 1543 and 1550 Pierre Gylles saw it in ruins. Süleyman I caught sight of it when out hunting and ordered Sinan to repair it, incorporating it into the system of Kırkҫeşme (1563-64).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="202">202</span></h2>
<p>AQUEDUCT OF VALENS, BOZDOĞAN KEMERİ
</p><p>Byzantine. D.7., E. 6-7. C Middle of the Fatih Group.
</p><p>Connecting the tops of the third and fourth hills (University - Fatih), this aqueduct collects the water from the upper slopes of the hills separating the basin of the Kağıthane, the Sweet Waters of Europe and those of the Marmara. This water, the purest of Istanbul, supplied first the Byzantine palaces and then those of the sultans.
</p><p>...
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="203">203</span></h2>
<p><b>THE BENDS</b>
</p><p>The Persian word bend signifies a barrage, a dam. To-day it is applied to the great reservoirs constructed by the Byzantine emperors and afterwards by the Ottoman sultans in the Forest of Belgrad.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="204">204</span></h2>
<p>They are veritable works of art, intended to collect spring water, which is then taken by underground pipe lines and the aqueduct that stride over the valleys, as far as the city. They serve also to let the water stand and allow its impurities to settle, as was done in the open Byzantine cisterns. There are seven bends. They are in the neighbourhood of the deserted village of Belgrad, the old Byzantine village of Petra, founded by Andronicus Comnenus, the name of
which was changed when a party of Serbian prisoners of war were camped there and given charge of the water service.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="205">205</span></h2>
<p>The construction of the first bend must certainly date from Constantine, for the Romans were the most advanced people of antiquity in hydraulics. Besides, the Byzantine writer Nicetas Khoniates relates (Lib. II p. 164) that the Emperor Andronicus I Comnenus (1183-1195) renovated the artificial supply of water in the neighbourhood of Pyrgos (Kemerburgaz), so it is clear that they were in existence previously. The sultans maintained them, extended and improved them, for there is no better judge of good drinking water than the Turk.
</p><p>AYVAT BENDİ
Built in the Ayvat valley, seven kilometres north of Kemerburgaz by Sultan Mustafa III in 1766: the dam is faced with white marble from Marmara.
</p><p>KARANLIKTOPUZ BENDİ
Situated 1200 metres north of the deserted village of Belgrad. Its history is the same as that of the Great Bend. Its water follow the same route and end at the same point. It was built by Ahmed III in 1722.
</p><p>THE GREAT BEND
</p><p>Situated one kilometre south of the old village of Belgrad. Constructed in the Byzantine period, it was restored by the Emperor Andronicus I and restored by the Sultans Mehmet, Fatih, Süleyman I the Lawgiver, and Mahmut I in 1747 and Abdul Hamit I in 1785. The waters are taken to the Ayasofya taksim by the Crooked Aqueduct from Kemerburgaz and the taksim of Eğrikapı.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="206">206</span></h2>
<p>MAHMUT BENDİ
</p><p>Situated across the eastern end of the valley of Bahҫeköyü, near the village of that name. It is 88 m long, with a spur on the up-slope. It is by no means lacking in grandeur. Due to the muniﬁcence of Sultan Mahmut I in 1732, this bend was restored by Abdul Hamit I in 1784. It is faced with white marble. The water supplies Beyoğlu and the Bosphorus villages.
</p><p>PAŞADERESİ BENDİ OR LITTLE BEND
</p><p>South east of the Great Bend, 3 kms. through the forest. The water goes to the Eğrikapı taksim.
</p><p>VALİDE BENDİ
In the valley near the Mahmut Bend, a kilometre north of Bahҫeköyü. Built by the Validé Mihrişah, mother of Sultan Selim III, in 1796. She did not grudge the marble for it.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="571">571</span></h2>
<p><b>THE FOREST OF BELGRAD, ITS AQUEDUCTS AND ITS BENDS</b>
</p><p>Outside the city: in the district west of the Bosphorus.
</p><p>About 25 kms. towards the north, the Bosphorus extemity of Thrace is almost entirely covered by a vast forest of oaks and chestnuts. Since the earliest days of the East Roman Empire this shady district, with its hills and vales, where flow numerous brooks fed by limpid springs, has been a natural reservoir for the water supply of the old capital of the Bosphorus. Also, the early emperors built here huge reservoirs by throwing up massive dams across the valleys. The water thus collected was brought to the town by wide subterranean channels, striding across the valleys by immense aqueducts often several hundred metres in length. The Emperor Theodosius I (378-395) seems to have been the first emperor to have built an aqueduct, which was finished in 396. After him the emperors generally&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="572">572</span></h2>
<p>maintained these great works against damage by earthquakes, tempess and human foes. The Avars in particular, in the seventh century, did great damage and the Emperor Constantine V
Copronymus in 758 was obliged to repair and almost rebuild them. Under the sultans the Turks, being great lovers of good water, completely renovated the reservoirs, aqueducts and channels and new works were constructed. The great architect Sinan filled the forest of Belgrad with splendid alqueducts, which to this day stride boldly across the valleys of the Cydaris and Barbyzes. In Byzantine days the maintenance and protection of these reservoirs was entrusted to the natives of the village of Petra. These formed a regular caste of officials and the task of waterman descended from father to son, with recognised privileges. When the sultans renewed the reservoirs the Serbian watermen captured by the seizure of Belgrad by
Süleyman the Lawgiver in 1521 were settled at Petra for the purpose. The village then almost at once took the name of Belgrad, which was soon extended to the whole of the forest itself.
</p><p>Of all the surroundings of Istanbul, especially on the European shore, the forest of Belgrad is certainly the most picturcsque and captivating. Lofty thickets of oaks, of chestnuts and beech cover the ground, which is carpeted with charming and fragrant ﬂowers. All around we hear the gentle murmur of the brooks babbling in the little valleys, blending their gentle plattie with the rustling of the foliage is the breeze and the warbling of the nightingales and brackbirds.
</p><p>in 1638 and 1639 in the reign of Murat IV, a fearful pestilence broke out in IStanbul, striking down all without distinction among all ranks of the population.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="573">573</span></h2>
<p>The foreign ambassadors who, since the end of the sixteenth century had left Galata and were installed among the vines of Beyoğlu, were terrified of this plague and it is asserted that, fleeing before its ravages, they abandoned the town and settled in the forest of Belgrad and neighbourhood of Domusdere, near the coast of the Black Sea. By the side of the village of Belgrad there sprang up a second village, where the diplomats built themselves nice houses, which did not fail to attract the rank and fashion of the foreign and Christian population. At that time England was represented by Sir Sackville Crow, who stayed until 1660. It is supposed, although no document mentions it, that it was he who had built the Anglican stone and brickrchurch, the ruins of which are still standing on the old site of the village of Belgrad.
</p><p>During the day the ambassadors devoted their time to the pleasures of the chase, for in these shady woodlands there was abundance of boar and deer, of fox and pheasants and other game, both fur and feather. In the evening they amused themselves with dancing, with play and feasts, which enabled a whole society to pass its time agreably.
</p><p>Travellers of the seventeenth and eighteenth century have left us fragmentary details of this rural life of the ambassadors in this forgotten corner of the Bosphorian Thrace. The Reverend Father Robert de Dreux, almoner to the French Ambassador de la Haye-Vantelet, describes his visit to Belgrad. On the 26th August, he with the French ambassador, he dined with the English ambassador.
</p><p>There are delightful walks around here, but it is necessary to leave someone to take care of the car. The most suitable way of seeing the forest is on foot, where charming spots may be discovered and works of art bequeathed to us by the centuries.
</p><p><b>First Walk</b>
</p><p>To the group of bends of the Valide, Sultan Mahmut and the Topuzlu. Go to Büyükdere by the Maslak road: turn to the left in the valley as far as the end of the asphalted road. After ten minutes we pass first under the aqueduct of Sultan Mahmut, then in front of the School of Forestry with its nurseries, the village of Bahҫeköy, and come to the open space by the bend of Sultan Mahmut, where there is a cafe.&#160;
</p><p>The car can be left here without anxiety, as there are the rangers and guards about. It is easy, by going up on the right of the left hand bend, the Mahmut bendi, to have a bird's eye view of it. Then we go to the bottom of the valley where we see the Valide bendi, climbing through the undergrowth on the left or right.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="574">574</span></h2>
<p>For the Topuzlu bendi, also known as the Eski Sultan Mahmut bendi, also known as the Eski Sultan Mahmut bendi, it is necessary to cross the bridge facing the little open place, to the left of the rangers' house, and follow the path which turns to the right. We get there in thirty minutes walk (See: p, 206). Return by the Bosphorus road.&#160;
</p><p><b>Second Walk</b>
</p><p>Group at the Great Bend, Kirazli bend, of the Ağa fountain and the old village of Belgrad with the Anglican chapel.
</p><p>By car. Some run but after passing under the aqueduct, at 250 metres, turn to the left and take the road to Kemerburgaz. After about ten minutes, at the bottom of a gentle dip, and
on a bend to the right a rather wide road comes in sight. Leave the car and walk in on the left under the wood: in five minutes we pass a secondary cistern or havuz, which is a meeting point for the pipes: five minute later we come to the Kirazli bendi.
</p><p>Return to the car and pass this time to the right of the road into a well marked path: here we first meet the Ҫifte havuz, where are collected the waters of the Great Bend: then, after a slope through the forest we come to the head of the great Bend in 15 minutes. Walk round the bend, hugging it on the left, and after an hour's walk, we come to the Ağa's spring, near which, in a little clearing, there flows a limpid spring that invites us to lunch. The spring is near the old road of the village of Belgrad. Going up towards the west, we pass along the valey of Roses, at the bottom which streches the Great Bend. After another six minutes walk on the level, to the right masked by a row of trees is a clearing planted with fruit trees. The ruins of the Anglican church of Belgrad are there, in the midst of the other invisible ruins of the village.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="575">575</span></h2>
<p>These form a square with a side of about 18 metres. The church was built in brick and stone: there is still to be seen the outer polygonal apse with a niche, the head arch of which is formed by a double course of bricks and one of side windows: we can guess where the entrance door is. To-day the forest has resumed its rights and it covers the walls with its tendrils.
</p><p>About 1750 the reservoirs, being badly maintained, set up endemic malaria in the neighbourhood, so the ambassador abandoned Belgrad for good. The English church probably
became the property of the Orthodox Greek community, which put a church there with the name of St. George. To the north east of the ruins is still to be seen the mouth of a well that
the Greeks still call the ayazma of St. George.
</p><p>That is all that is left of the famous diplomatic village, the ruins, more and more dilapidated, of the English church, a well and heaps of stones hidden in the thickets. The roads, the open places, rich residences and humble houses, cemeteries and all, all has disappeared since 1896, when the Sultan Abdul Hamit had all the villages in the forest evacuated on the grounds
that their presence there would pollute the water supply of Istanbul.
</p><p>But the topography remains the same. The Valley of Rosee, where still some stunted rose trees grow, descendants of those of other days, still leads down to the Great Bend. The spring of the Ağa, which is perhaps at the spot of which Lady Montague writes, is still there with its refreshing waters, like a forgotten sentinel. Who knows if, when the sun has sunk in the forest, the rustling of the foliage in the Black Sea breezes may not repeat to-day the echoes intoken of eternal gratitude of the laughter of the charming Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whose visit and letters describe this village now asleep forever in the religious calm of this lovely forest.
</p><p>We return to the road and carry on, keeping to the right, as far as Karanlık topuz bendi, about 1200 metres. The visit over we return as far as the Spring of Ağa, whence we can pick up our car either crossing through the woods or making the tour by the road we came, as far as the motor road. The walk can take about three or three and a half hours. If one loses the way, one should always follow the paths which lead to the south or east, for they all lead to a road.
</p><p><b>Third Walk</b>
</p><p>The Elbowed Aqueduct, also called Eğrikemer and Kovukkemer, Kemerburgaz. The Long Aqueduct, Uzun Kemer, Kurt Kemeri, Ayvat Bendi.&#160;
</p><p>We can go as far as Kemerburgaz either by the forest of Belgrad, following the road of the Second Walk, or, on leaving
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="576">576</span></h2>
<p>from Şişli-Kağıthane and following the valley along the stream. After three quarters of an hour we come to the Elbowed Aqueduct, Eğrikemer, and in ten minutes more Kemerburgaz, the old Pyrgos. From this village, which has developed a great deal in recent years, we can follow the road up the valley in a car as far as the Long Aqueduct, Uzun Kemer. Here we leave the car and walk up the brook Ayvatderesi, which forks on the right, and in half an hour come to the Kurtkemeri, the Wolf Aqueduct. Then we follow the central valley and in three quarters of an hour we come to Ayvatkemeri, and the Ayvat bendi, in a rather wild and open country. Then back by car to Kemerburgaz and to Istanbul by the Forest of Belgrad or by the road by which we came.
</p><p><b>Fourth Walk</b>
</p><p>Kemerburgaz - Bashavuz of Osman II - Aqueduct of Justinian or Maglova kemeri - Güzelce kemeri.
</p><p>We go to Kemerburgaz by one of the two roads given above and leaving the car there, cross the valley downhill towards the right as far as Başhavuz of Osman II, in half an hour. From this point follow the path along the water way and in half an hour come to Justinian’s aqueduct. From here to the aqueduct called Güzelce two paths are open: the one on the right which turns by the village of Cebeci in sixty minutes, and the one on the left which takes you back more directly to Kemerburgaz in forty minutes by the bottom of the valley of Alibey, the ancient Kydaris, passing again, after Justinian's Aqueduct, the Başhavuz of Osman II. If these last three excursions are done
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="577">577</span></h2>
<p>in a jeep, we can get right through almost everywhere by modifying the order. In the fourth walk from Cebeciköy we could generally follow back the road along along the stream by Taşköprü as far as Alibeyköyü, Eyüp and the town of Kağıthane and Şişli. On foot from Cebeciköyü to Taşköprü it takes 75 minutes: from that point to Silahtarağa an hour and thence to Eyüp 45 minutes.
