<p>Aqueducts. Water has been brought to Constantinople at great expence, and is very necessary in this country, where they drink it in such great quantities, and use so much for washing and bathing; and the more care has been taken, because a want of it would certainly cause a rebellion in the city; for this purpose they formerly made so many large cisterns as reservoirs of the water of the aqueduct, in case it should fail; and the great cistern under Saint Sophia serves for that purpose at this time: The most ancient aqueduct was built by the emperors Valens and Valentinian; this aqueduct is seen in three places; it conveys water to the city at the distance of ten miles, being brought for the most part from places three or four miles to the south east of the village called Belgrade. These three parts of the aqueduct are called the crooked aqueduct, the long aqueduct, and the high aqueduct; the last is nearest to Constantinople, and receives the water that comes from the other two which are different streams: The crooked aqueduct is so called, because it makes a turn before it crosses the valley from one hill to the other; this aqueduct is executed in a very fine taste; it is a rustick work, and consists of three tiers of fine arches one over another. The water first runs on a wall, and then on twelve arches, for two hundred and twenty one yards; it then turns and crosses the vale on the three tiers of arches; in the lowest there are four arches, in the middle ten, and there are passages made through the piers in the length of the aqueduct, by which one passes to the other side of the valley; in the uppermost tier there are twenty one arches, the seven or eight first arches on each side are built on the descent of the hill, two or three on the solid wall, and ten over the middle arches; in the upper story also there are arches through fifteen of the piers, in order to pass the whole length of the aqueduct, as it has been observed there are through the piers of the middle arches&#160;; the aqueduct being in that part about fix hundred and seventy-two feet long, and a hundred and seven feet high: It is a very magnificent work, and the water is conveyed to it from a rivulet that passes near Belgrade, and must be the Hydraulis; the water of this river is stopped in two different places by a wall built across, so as to make two large lakes, and runs in channels thro' the wall, which is built to keep them up; these seem to be Turkish works, and designed as reservoirs of water in cafe the rivulet should dry up in summer, that they might be supplied by two such great bodies of water to be let out by lower channels which are in the wall, and may be opened on occasion; from the last of these the water passes to a deep basin, into which some other streams are brought, and from that it runs partly in the channels made on the side of the hills, and partly on arches over valleys, and hollows in the hills, to the crooked aqueduct already described, from which it rims on the sides of the hills into another bason, and so does the water of the long aqueduct, and from that bason it goes in one channel to the high aqueduct. The other, called the long aqueduct, seems to be a modern work, and, I suppose, was built by Soliman the magnificent, who is said to have repaired the other aqueducts; and if it was, it is a work truly worthy of him; and I saw on it a short Turkish inscription: It was built as a further supply of water to be conveyed by the high aqueduct; it is two thousand two hundred and twenty-nine feet long, eighty-five feet and a half high, and the wall is twelve feet thick; it consists of two stories of arches one over another; in the lower story there are forty-seven larches, and fifty in the upper: At the first descent, at each end of the hills, the water runs on a long wall: Other streams are brought to this water by the side of the southern hill, which passes likewise on a small number of arches over the valleys that are in the way. The water of this aqueduct, as observed, communicates with the crooked aqueduct, and both run to the high aqueduct, which is a vast massive rustic building, by which the water is conveyed over a valley; it is above eight hundred and forty feet long, and one hundred and twelve feet high; it consists of four large arches, as many over them, and three stories of small ones between them, there being nine arches in the upper and lower stories, and fix in the middle one. This irregularity, contrary to the manner of the ancients, and the arches not being true, gives this aqueduct a very Gothic appearance, though it is a work of great expence and magnificence, for the walls are fifteen feet thick; and the great arches are above fifty feet wide. Ascending by the hill to one of the small arches, there is an arched passage from it through the wall, consisting of forty-four steps, which leads up to the great arches above, where there is a passage through the piers, as in the crooked aqueduct, and a descent likewise by flairs at (the other end: From this aqueduct the water runs along the side of the hills, in channels covered in with stone, there being arches built only in two or three places. This water formerly run on those arches in the third valley between the third and fourth hill; but the east part of that aqueduct being destroyed, the water is conveyed in channels on the ground to the several parts of the city. About ten years ago a new aqueduct was built to supply Pera, Galata, and the neighbouring villages; the water comes from Bauchicui, between Belgrade and Boiyucderry, and runs across a valley there on an aqueduct which consists of a great number of arches that are very well built; from this valley it runs round the hills, and sometimes under ground, and crossing a low ground it rises in such square pillars as have been before described, in order to keep the water to its height: As it passes, part of it is conveyed to the villages on the west side of the canal of the Thracian Bosphorus, and coming near Pera, it rises in the fame fort of pillars, and runs into a reservoir, consisting of many little cells made to contain the water, and is conveyed from them to the fsveral parts of Pera and Galata.
</p><p>The point of Galata opposite to the seraglio was called cape Metopon. Beshicktash is said to have been formerly called Jason from his touching there; at that place there was a grove of cypress trees, and a temple of Apollo. At Ortacui there was a port called Clidium; and lower there was a port in which the vessels of the Rhodians used to lie, which, 1 suppose, is the place where ships now ride at anchor near Beshicktash when they are, ready to fail, because it is difficult to go out of the port with a strong north wind. The cape at Cruchiesme was in the middle ages called Asomaton. The bay which had the name of Scalæ was at Arnautcui; below it is the cape of Esties; further there is a large bay, on which Bactesu is situated: 
</p><p>The cape on which the castle stands, and where the bridge is supposed to have been was called cape Mercury. The best port of the Bosphorus was at the river Ornousdera, it is called Sarantacopa, and by Dionysus Byzantinus, Leostenion. Under Tharapia is the rock Catargo: Here is a small river, and the port Pharmaias, which is said to be so called, because Medea touching at this place opened her box of drugs there. The bay of Boiyucdery was called Sinus Saronicus from an altar there to Saron of Megara; the point of this bay to the north was called Amilton and Tripition by the Greeks. The convent of Mavro-Molo higher up was destroyed, because it was a place of debauchery for sailors and other inferior people. As to the Cyanean rock on the Europe side; at the foot of it there is a white marble pillar broken into three or four pieces and a Corinthian capital near it; the shaft is two feet in diameter; above on the rock is what has been thought by some to have been its pedestal; it is about three feet in diameter, and has round it four sesloons joined by bulls heads: There are many names on it, which seem to have been cut by people that came there. The name of Augustus, mentioned by some authors, I suppose, is SEBASTVS, which is cut on the stone in Roman characters, much better than the other, and very near to the base of the pedestal: This is more justly thought to be an altar to Apollo, which the Romans placed on this rock; tho' from the holes for irons both above and below, it seems as if some other stones were fixed to it, which would rather incline one to conclude that it was the pedestal of a pillar. On the continent near this island is the light house of Europe, which is a high tower. Going along the coast of the Euxine sea in Thrace towards the west the first place mentioned in Phinopolis, which seems to be the court of Phineus, from which the Arganauts went (after they had been stopped by contrary winds) to the Asia side, and sacrifised to the twelve gods: It is possible this place put in the Tables was on the west side of that broad cape, which is about two leagues to the west of the cape at the entrance of the Bosphorus, where I saw a square tower on the height with some ancient stones in it. I observed here in the sea cliffs a layer of earth about three feet thick, which appears like planks of timber burnt to a coal. About eighteen miles to the west of this tower was Philea, Phrygia on the Palus Phileatina; this place is about the same distance also from Belgrade: What is called the lake is a fort of gulph that winds into the land, and there are some rivulets that run into it; as well as I could learn there is a bank of sand before the mouth of it, which is covered with water in winter, and when the wind blows strong from the north; there is now a small port on the outside of it. The town was on a peninsula at the east end of the gulph, on very high ground to the west and north, having a gentle descent to the south: On the east side it was defended with a wall, a great part of which is still remaining, and is called by the Turks Dourkous, town and lake: If there had been a good entrance for shipping, this town, which is not a mile in circumference, would have been very finely situated for trade Halmedyssus or Salmedyssus s said to have been forty miles further; they informed me of a port twenty miles off, which, if I mistake not, is called Aiade, it is well frequented, and probably is the ancient Halmedyssus, though there seems to be a mistake in the distance. I was informed that there are some ruins there, especially of the wall that was built by the emperor Anastasius across the neck of the peninsula to Selivre, the old Selymbria. I was informed that this place is about thirty-six miles from Selivre, and as far from Constantinople. All the country this way is a very rich soil, and abounds with wood; and the village of Belgrade is situated in a wood; the English, Swedish, and Dutch Ambassadors reside there in summer, where they have cool shady walks in the woods by the two large basons of water which are to supply the aqueduct.
