<p>About a dozen or fifteen Miles North from Gallata, towards the Black Sea, we went to see a place, which from the Beauty and Pleasantness of it, is called Belgrade. The Country lies high, shaded with abundance of Woods, watered with many wholsom Springs, stored with several sorts of Game, accommodated with several small Villages, at convenient Distances, and the Air very good and healthful. To these shady Woods, many Persons of Quality, as well of the Turks as Ambassadours, and rich Merchants, retire to enjoy the fresh Air in the scorching Heats of Summer, and to hunt at the proper Seasons of the Year.
</p><p>Here some build them pretty Houses of Pleasure, others stately Chiosques, or Banquetting-Houses; and others content themselves to sojourn in Tents, they stretch out under the tall Trees, near some refreshing Spring. All these Springs are with greater Charges, collected into several large Cisterns; near each of which is built a stately Chiosque, or Summer-house . The usual Form of them is square, contrived so with large Pent-house-Roofs for shade; yet so open round about, that one enjoys all the Liberty, Freshness, and Goodness of the open Air, without the least Inconvenience from the heat of the Sun. You mount up to them by four or five Steps, to an Area paved with Purcelane Tile or Marble, covered with Indian Mats or Carpets, with Balusters or Rails about it. The Roof also within, is painted with several Colours, as red, green, white, and yellow; and pretty Knots of Figures wrought on them.
</p><p>From these Cisterns, the Water is conveyed by Channels under ground, to the several Aqueducts, that carry it by many Windings and Turnings over the low Valleys, from the tops of Hills to Hills; until at last it is brought with a vast Charge to Constantinople. Several of these we observed, both in our way thither, and return to Gallata: Especially, one about mid -way, joyning two Hills together cross a Valley, at least half a Mile over. This consists of two Ranges of Arches; whereof the lowermost hath fifty, and the uppermost fifty one; and I believe, from the deepest part of the Valley, to the top of the Aqueduct, is above thirty Yards. There is another in sight of this Eastwards, which bends and makes an Angle: This hath three Ranges of Arches one above the other, but not so many in number. North of this first, we saw another, which joyns two Hills together by a narrow, but very deep Valley. This hath but four Arches in two Ranges, but the Arches are exceeding large; I measured them not: but Mr. Smith faith, They are above fifty Foot wide. The Care of these Waters, and the cleansing of these Aqueducts, and Channels, are imposed upon the adjacent Villages; for which service, they are freed from all other Taxes. Most of these Aqueducts were built by the latter Roman and Greek Emperours: But by Time , Wars, and Negligence, being run to decay and ruined, they were repaired again at the great Charge, and indefatigable Industry of Sultan Suliman; who for this, and the stately Mosque he built in the City, was deservedly called the Magnificent. 
</p><p>These Waters being thus brought to the City, are again collected into several great Cisterns; and thence again, by earthen Pipes, dispersed to the several Quarters, private Houses, and publick Buildings of the City: Whereof one is against
</p><p>the wall of the City by Ballata, another under Hagia -Sophia; and Mr. Smith speaks of one at Sultan Selim's Mosque.
</p><p>The Plants I took notice of hereabouts, were 1. A kind of Dwarf Abrotonum , with Flowers like Cammomil . 2. A sort of Serpillum, with Leaves like Savoury; the Smell also differing from ours.
</p><p>I found another Plant going thither, and to the Black-Sea also; which I know not to what species to refer, unless to Androsemum majus which we call Parks-Leaves: For the Leaves are of the substance and colour, only longer, and of a more tough Substance, growing two by two, on a shrubby square Stalk, of a reddish colour, not rising from the ground above a span high: On the top of which succeedeth a large yellow Flower, much bigger than Parks-Leaves, filled with a large Tuft of the same; out of which, before the Flower is fallen, beginneth to rise a long Vessel, divided into five Appartments full of reddish Seeds. The Smell is like the best Turpentine; but more fragrant, and like Coris. Of it I observed two forts: The difference is only, that the one hath its Leaves growing by pairs, flat, like a Jacob's Ladder, and the other by pairs cross each other. It spreads upon the Ground in heaps; so that feldom one shall find one Stalk alone.
</p><p>Since my writing this, I find that Dr. Morison hath described this Plant in his excellent History of Plants, having raised it in the Botanick Garden at Oxford, of which Science he is the Learned Professour, out of the Seeds I sent to that University; and hath named it, Androsemum Olympii montis flore eu femine Theca quinque Capsularii ominum maximus: which is extreamly well distinguished; only he should have put in Byzantinum or Constantinopolitanum, instead of Montis Olympii; as he hath done lately in a Letter to me, with the Design of the Plant I here give you.
</p><p>I also there saw some Trees of Guaiacum Patavinum, which were us as a Rarity at Pera .
</p><p>We waited a good while for a calm day, to go to the mouth of the Black Sea, to see the pillar vulgarly called Pompey's Pillar: For the North-wind reigns much in that sea; and when it bloweth, there is no passing against it and the Stream. We took a good strong Boat with six Oars; and left on each hand as we were turning the point of Gallata, many Villages, whose Situations are very pleasant, with Rocks,Hills and Promontories, covered with Chesnuts, Olives and Cypress Trees; besides many of the Basha's other great Mens Seraglio's, or Houses of Pleasure. I never saw more beautiful, nor greater Variety of Prospects where Motion of the Boat each moment changeth the Scene. On the Thracian Shore from Gallata are these: viz Tophana, Fondukli Bechikroash, Ortaqui, Coront, Schesine, Arnaudqui, Bebelbakchisi, Eski-hissar or Old Castle, Bartoliman, Stegna, Jegniqui, Therania, Boindore, Sariior, Fanari: where is a Light-House just within the Mouth of the Sea, on the right hand; and on the shore of Natolia, beginning from Scutari are Cousch-couiouk, Stauros, Chenguelqui, Coula bakchisi, Candel-bakchesi, Eski-hissar, or Old Castle of Natolia: both defend these Streights from Incursions from the Euxin, or Black-Sea, Guiosqui, Chiboucli, Inguirliqui, Oncliar, Skelosi, Beicos, Salicevroun, Joro, in old time Fanum; because probably it was a Light-House in those times. A little without the Entrance, on the left hand, is the Rock whereon standeth the Pillar. It is of the Corinthian Order, up on a Basis, and both of white Marble; upon which is an Inscription, that sheweth it to have been dedicated to Augustus. But it is imperfect, and so worn with standing bleak to the Winds, that to make any more of it, 'is past the Skill of the Antiquaries; some calling the last word PONTO, and some FRONTO. The other Lines are imperfect likewise: For at the beginning is a part of a Letter, that may be taken for either a C, or an O. If the first, it must be C. CAESARI AVGVSTO. But otherwise only, the end of a word, as by the E in the next line, seemeth very probable: And Mr. Sands maketh it it to be DIVO, as probably it was: So that the first line may be DIVO CAESARI AVGVSTO. 
</p><p>As to the next Line, I would conclude with Mr. Sands, That it is L. CLANNIDIVS , if I could have found any such Name among the Roman Families: But I find only Annidins. And besides my own, Monsieur Spon's, and Mr. Smith's Observation, make the first letter an E; and must therefore be the last letter in a word; as in many Inscriptions I have seen E written for ET, and then I would put a point between CL. and Annidius; and then it would be for &amp; Claudius Annidius: For CL. is put for Claudius, and not CLAU. except there is a Prænomen before it. 
</p><p>The last line is as much travers't as any. The first two letters that Mr. Smith makes LE. are undoubtedly L.F. Luei Filius; as it is in Mr. Sands, Monfieur Spon's, and my own Observation took upon the Place. As to the rest, there is room enough for every one to have his Fancy. Mr. Sands makes it CLAPONTO, which Mr. Smith interpreteth CLASSIS I PONTO; and so maketh it the Payment of a Vow of some, that had safely conducted their Navy through this dangerous Sea. Monsieur Spon makes it CLA. FRONTO.
</p><p>But what it can so signify, I cannot tell. It is true, RONTO is plainly to be read; but the next Letter is very much defaced; but i fansied it to be another R, which I marked down in my Book with points: the first long stroke is entire, and plain; but for the rest of it, one hath much adoe to make some worn-out Marks hang together. As to the A, the L, and the C, ordine retrogrado following , they are plainly to be read. So that , if I were to be its Restitutor, i would write it
</p><p>DIVO CAESARI AVGVSTO
</p><p>E CL . ANNIDIUS
</p><p>L.F. CL. ARRONTO
</p><p>I find the Family Arruntius in Gruterus, in many Inscriptions; and O for V might be an easie mistake of the Graver, in so remote a Country, if not of the Person himself: And we know, that Letters were not every ones Talent in those days. And to conclude, I believe the Basis upon which this Inscription is, was not made for that Pillar, because they bear no proportion one with another. It has been, in my opinion, a round Altar, being carved about with Wreaths of abundance, sustained by Bull's-heads. The white Pillar (which I judge about ten foot high above it) might have been erected upon it, to serve for a Sea-mark by day, as the Lanthorn at Fanari doth by night: Indeed, I should think it any thing, rather than a Pillar erected to Pompey. The Rock on which it stands, is one of the Cyanea, or Symplegades of the Antients; fansied to float, because sometimes seen together, as they thought, seeing them from several Stations. But some of them are placed on the one side of the Entrance of the Bosphorus, and some on the other. Mr. Smith counted four on the European side: But the North-wind beginning to rise, we were forced to return soon after the viewing of the Pillar.
</p><p>In our return, about six Miles from the Pillar, we stopped to see a Greek Church, upon the highest of the Hills on the Thracian Shore, called Mavronides. It is a place of very great Devotion among the Greeks, and payeth no Taxes to the Grand Signior; only a few Cherries for his own eating. The reason of which they told us was this! The Grand Signior being a hunting at Belgrade, and eagerly pursuing his Game this way, lost his Attendants, and came to this place; where being weary, hot, and dry, he alighted to repose and refresh himself and demanding Water of the poor Caloyers, who knew him, one of them readily brought him some Bread and Water, and fresh-gathered Cherries, which are there excellent good: at which he seemed very well pleased, and told him, That if he would change his Religion, he would promote him to great Honour. (Wheler 1682:154) But the poor, yet faithful Christian, resolving not to part with his Faith, would he have given him his Empire; and knowing he could give that proud Tyrant no Answer that would please him, and secure his Conscience void of offence, on that Subject, made no Answer at all; but fixed his Eyes up on the ground, notwithstanding all he could say to him. At which he greatly wondering, and admiring his Constancy, told him, That for this Service, that Place should pay no Caratch, only some Cherries yearly to the Seraglio, for his own eating.
