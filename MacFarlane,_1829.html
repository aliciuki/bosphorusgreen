<p>In the gratification of that taste for scouring over wide moors and solitary plains, which I have alluded to in the course of my journeyings in Asia Minor, I frequently left the beautiful scenery of the Bosphorus, (which is indeed the only beautiful scenery here,) far behind me.
</p><p>The solitude and wildness begin at the distance of a gunshot from the town; the country, however, for some distance, is irregular with hills and hollows, but Turkish horses are accustomed to ascend and descend them at a gallop, and away we used to scamper over them, until we came to a vast flat heath, cut only here and there with deep ravines, which we could gallop along either to Pyrgos, or the forest and village of Belgrade, or to Therapia, or Buyukdere, or stop half way, at a pleasant distance from town, at the selictar’s chiflik, a pretty kiosk, with an artificial pond, a flower-garden, and a vineyard, in a romantic glen…
</p><p>The whole of their neighbourhood, the whole of the country between Constantinople and the forest of Belgrade (a distance of twelve miles) is sandy and dry; the water-courses that traverse it, to supply the capital, from the bents or artificial reservoirs in the forest, run at a distance from the barracks; the little water that trickles in the hollows of the hills is dried up in summer; and at that season, one might look in vain for two narrow rivers, with classical names (the Cydaris and the Barbyses), which never carry more than an insignificant tribute to the waves of the Golden Horn. The deficiency, however, as relates to the barracks, might be easily corrected, by laying down ducts from the water-courses; and as, from the prescriptions of their faith, they require much water, and as their necessities have taught them some address in this branch of hydraulics, the work will probably soon be accomplished.
</p>

<p>Constantinople is supplied with water from bents or artificial reservoirs in the Forest of Belgrade, about twelve miles distant, by means of stately aqueducts (three of which were built by the (Greek emperors) and subterranean conduits. A project, which the Turks pretend the Empress Catherine once seriously entertained of suddenly landing a number of troops at Dumuzdere, at the mouth of the Bosphorus, who were thence to march to the reservoirs, a distance of only five or six miles, might yet be attempted; and the easily executed destruction of the bents by a brief incursion, might deprive the capital of water.
</p><p>As early as the month of June, three redoubts were raised to command the approaches to the reservoirs; the irregular troops on the coast, near and above Dumuzdere, communicated with the fortified positions, and could prevent surprise, whilst a body of troops at Daut-Pasha were held disposable for the support of the redoubts. These hastily and slightly formed fortifications (a shallow ditch and sand banks) were contemptible to look at, and not very well placed for the object proposed they were entirely abandoned, with all apprehensions of the Russian attempt, before the month of September...
</p><p>I must reserve my description of the Bosphorus from “the blue Symplegades” and the Giant’s Mouth to the basin of the Propontis, my sketches of the sylvan regions of Belgrade, the solitudes of Bulgurlu, and the gay retreats of the Princes’ Islands, with much other matter, for another “fitte”. I have been dwelling on the beauties that filled me with happiness, and occupied my mind to the exclusion of almost every thing beside, for many, many days, with an aching head, and nerves unstrung by fever; and reverting consideration from myself to the reader, I find I have inflicted a much heavier volume than I intended.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="300-301">300-301</span></h2>
<p>“Whoever has visited Constantinople, and has contemplated the vast and swampy tracts which extend around it in all directions, must immediately subscribe to this opinion i.e. that Constantinople is among the most unhealthy of European capitals). Dr. Clarke, though no physician, seized the truth at once; for the situation of Constantinople, notwithstanding it is the most beautiful tinder heaven, is certainly the most unhealthy. At a moderate calculation, I should estimate the marshy grounds lying immediately around its walls to be little short of twenty square miles. Let us trace on a map the low shores of the Propontis, furrowed by shallow muddy streams, obstructed at their mouths, and dilating into morasses. Contemplate the low grounds of Bithynia, the Lake of Nicea, and the fertile swampy valleys at the foot of Olympus, together with the harbour (the Golden Horn) itself, and the stagnating waters of Kiat-hane, and we shall be convinced, that of all places in Europe, Constantinople must suffer most from marsh effluvia.”
</p><p>Doctor Neale might have added the thick, impervious forest of Belgrade, at twelve miles from the city walls, with stagnant pools in its wooded hollows, and indeed many other insalubrious influences; and he should not have omitted the cold blasts from the Black Sea, which frequently, during the hottest days, nearly cut you through as you turn a corner. The gathered emaciated, fevered crowd I saw at the end of September, on the feast of a Panagea at Keflekeui, and an aiasma, or holy fountain on the Bosphorus, gave a direct contradiction to the boasted salubrity of its shores&#160;; and it is a notorious fact, that Pera is singularly obnoxious to all inflammatory disorders. Strangers are sure to pay a tribute of sickness on their arrival, or shortly after&#160;; and the suite of Governor Elphinstone, who arrived during my stay, and had travelled almost without an aching head, from India by land, all fell ill at Pera; and one of those gentlemen (as unlucky as myself) has had several returns of his Constantinople fever at London.

<p>As you ascend the Bosphorus from Constantinople, Buyukdere presents itself on the left, or European side, at the broadest part of the channel, and at the distance of about four miles from the “blue Symplegades,” which classical rocks are concealed under the Thracian shore, whilst the widening expanse of the Euxine sea beyond them meets the eye from particular points, and looks nearly always dark, cloudy, and cold. The Turkish name of Buyukdere, or “The great Valley,” is applicable, for it is by far the widest and most open on the channel, although its greatest width, which is at its entrance on the banks of the Bosphorus, does not exceed half a mile. The valley runs into the hills of Thrace, slightly ascending and contracting as it rises, for the distance of about two miles, where, at its narrowest and most elevated point, it is traversed by the aqueduct of Backchey-Koui, which is formed of two rows of pointed or Saracenic arches, and kept purely white. The aqueduct, indeed, terminates the valley; for beyond it you descend to an irregular heath, which finishes at a short distance, and just beyond the village of Backchey-Koui, on the “lisière” of the dark, thick forest of Belgrade. Whether you catch it from the bosom of the Bosphorus, or its shores, or in glancing up the valley, this aqueduct is a beautiful feature in the scene. Near the other end of the valley, and little more than a musket shot from the banks of the channel, is another object not less interesting — a plane-tree, or a junction of plane trees, of astonishing dimension and richness of foliage.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The valley, nearly all the way between the tree and the aqueduct, is a smooth, luxuriant carpet of the richest grass, confined on either side by cultivated patches and neat gardens, and by, gently ascending hills, covered with pleasant trees and evergreen underwood. A narrow brook, in summer a mere thread of water, trickles through this happy vale; but the richness of vegetation is independent of it, as its situation, the number of trees, and the contiguity of the vast forest of Belgrade, ensure sufficient moisture and perennial freshness.
</p><p>On either side of this lovely valley were disposed the tents of the Lancers and Hussars, and midway, between the two lines of tents, their horses were picketed and tended in the open air. A grand tent, with a temporary mosque and minaret, were erected for the Sultan in the shade of the magnificent plane-tree; and a little in their rear were two other vast tents one for the Selictar or sword-bearer, the other for the Seraskier. A range of guns covered this part of the encampment, and might command the landing place on the banks of the Bosphorus, whilst a redoubt or battery was thrown up under the aqueduct, at the upper part of the valley. The sounds of the trumpet and the Asiatic drum those sounds I so often listened to with delight on the heaths of Daut-Pasha and RamedChiflik the roar of artillery the evolutions of the troops the stirring activity of the camp by day, and its dead repose its watch fires its occasional watch-word by night, must, indeed, have been impressive in these romantic regions, where the divinities of the fields, and groves, and springs the brightest creations of classical mythology might have found homes assorted to their poetic natures.
</p><p>Although the Sultan lived at the villa Mattos, at Therapia, he passed much of his time, by day, at this encampment, and it was here he performed the religious duties and ceremonies of the great annual festival of the Courbann-Bairam.
</p><p>…By taking the splendid cavalcade from the Serraglio-gate in Constantinople as I have described it, or as more amply delineated by Dr. Clarke, and placing it in the enchanting valley of Buyukdere, the reader may form to himself a novel and imposing scene romantic and essentially oriental…

</p><p>Those who have described to me the interesting occurrences of that day, saw the sun rise, not in crossing the Golden Horn, as I had done the preceding year, but on the silvery channel of the Bosphorus at Buyukdere; and as its early rays shot along the valley, the Sovereign of the Osmanlis, with the same state that I have described, and followed by the same train, repaired to offer up his namaz in the temporary messdjid by the side of his tent — a humble substitute for the vast mosque of Sultan Achmet, or Santa Sophia — but Mahmood was considered as being in the field — its humility and narrowness accorded with the privations incident on a state of war, and in Mahometan estimation, the prayers to the one God and the great Prophet, are particularly grateful when rising from the tented field, and echoed by faithful hosts, in arms for the propagation or defence of Islamism. By taking the splendid cavalcade from the Serraglio gate to Constantinople as I have described it, or as more amply delineated by Dr. Clarke, and placing it in the enchanting valley of Buyukdere, the reader may form to himself a novel and imposing scene — romantic and essentially oriental.

<p>On the morning of the dreadful 15th of June, the commencement of as bloody a day as graces the red annals of the Osmanlis, and only a few minutes before the deadly struggle began in the city of Constantinople, between the Janissaries and the Sultan.
</p><p>…
</p><p>After their final defeat, the sufferings of the fugitive Janissaries were excessive. On the third day from that event one of the sons of Hadji-Bektash approached, at the dusk of the evening, the house of a Frank, in the village of Belgrade, and supplicated with a frantic but exhausted voice for a little bread! For three days he had tasted no food — for three days he had not dared to move from his place of concealment, lest he should be seen and destroyed.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The beautiful plane-tree of the valley of Buyukdere, is well described by Monsieur Olivier: “Seven or eight trees of an enormous size, adhering at their base, rise circularly, and leave in the middle a rather considerable space. A great many Greeks and Armenians were seated on the turf, under the shade of these trees, and smoking their pipes; different groups of Turkish and Armenian women, veiled, and surrounded by their children, were seated apart; some Greek women richly dressed, more or less handsome, fixed the looks and the attention of some Europeans whom the crowd of people had attracted. Several Turks were in the enclosure of the plane-tree (or within the circle formed by the different stems) smoking their pipes, and drinking coffee, which had just been prepared for them hand by.

The plane-tree often presents at its base, a considerable expansion of a diameter, double and treble that of the trunk, and which may exceed thirty feet; so that it frequently happens, when the tree dies of age, that it sends forth all round the stump, shoots which form so many new trees; this, no doubt, is what has happened to the plane-tree of Buyukdere. We remarked, indeed, that the seven or eight trunks of which it is formed, appear to have a common origin, and that they are all connected by their base.” — Voyages dans l’Empire Ottoman

In the course of the summer and autumn of 1828, I very frequently walked or rode by this tree, which presented much the same appearance as described in 1793, by the traveller quoted; and the groups gathered within the circle, or smoking in the shade, were always there.</span>

On quitting, he called down the direst imprecations on the workers of the present mischief to his corps; and said. Why do not the Russians come down on us?”</span>
