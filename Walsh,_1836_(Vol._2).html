<p>As I had taken the palace garden under my care, I was responsible for its well-doing. A part of it I wished to plant out with trees and shrubs; and as the woods of the Black Sea abounded, I was informed, with a great variety, and the country was now in a state of comparative tranquillity, I took the palace gardener with me, and proceeded to Belgrade, in the centre of the woods.
</p><p>Among the objects of curiosity that led me to this place were the reservoirs of water, by which the ancient and modem city was and is supplied. The only fresh water near the city was found in the small and muddy streams of the Cydaris and Barbyses falling into the head of the harbour, and forming there what the ancients called the Marcidum Mare, or Putrid Sea, and called for that reason, I suppose, by the French, Les Eaux Duces, and by the English, after them “The Sweet Waters" and as they flowed at such a distance below the elevation of the town that it was impossible to conduct them to the city above by any knowledge of hydrostatics the Greeks then possessed, they were obliged to seek another source, and they found it among the mountains of the Euxine. It was the region of constant showers and perennial streams, which they conducted to the capital. Wherever the rills poured down and became confluent in a little valley, they were there arrested, by throwing a mound across; and in this way they accumulated, till they formed various triangular lakes at an elevation above the level of the city, to which they were conveyed by pipes and aqueducts, wherever a valley interposed. Two of the aqueducts still remain, ten or twelve miles from the capital, one attributed to Constantine, and the other to the indefatigable Justinian. The first has three tiers of arches, and is about three hundred and twenty in length. The second is more magnificent; the arches form but two tiers, but they stretch for seven hundred and fifty feet, and ascend to the height of one hundred and ten: a gallery runs through it, and forms a passage across the valley, over which it carries the water.
</p><p>The water when conveyed to the city was distributed by another system of pipes and aqueducts to different reservoirs among the hills. Of the city aqueducts, three are noticed by historians, one erected by Adrian for the benefit of the Byzantines, of which no trace is now to be seen. A second by Theodosius, which is described as an incredible work, which brought a river underground and through the air of this also all traces are lost. The third, erected by Valens, is most celebrated by writers. A curious anecdote is related of its erection. The Emperor, incensed at the conduct of the inhabitants of Chalcedon, who had favoured the party of Procopius, ordered their walls to be pulled down. Among the stones was found one with oracular inscription, implying, that the walls of Chalcedon should bring a great supply of water to the city. Prophecies were powerful incentives in those days, so, to accomplish the prediction, Valens erected his aqueduct with the prophetic stones. This is described by all writers as
</p><p>very magnificent. It was held of such importance and in such respect by the Turks, that the reparation of it was one of the three prayers which the Sultan Solyman hoped to accomplish before his death. This aqueduct is the only one that remains at this day, and it attests the accuracy of historians who describe it. It extends across the valley, from the Mosque of Sultan Mahomed to that of Schasabba, and forms the most conspicuous object in Constantinople. It consists of three ranges of arches, one above the other, and accords exactly with the description of Douza and others, in conveying an aerial river far above the tops of the houses. The streets in some places lead through it, and in others along the side of it, and from different parts pipes descend, conveying water to all the neighbourhood. Vines and other plants have established themselves in the interstices, and the roots imbibing the humidity which oozes out in different places, hang down in rich festoons, adorning this venerable structure with their vegetable drapery.
</p><p>The water conveyed by these aqueducts of the Lower Empire was received in various excavations, so that the hills of the city abounded in reservoirs, like those of the Black Sea. Some of these reservoirs were open to the air, and some covered in. Of the first, six are yet remaining, many of which I explored. They are quadrangular enclosures of solid walls of masonry, varying in size, and some of them eight hundred feet in length: their extensive area induced travellers to believe they were originally intended for Naumachia; but as no such places are mentioned by the Byzantine historians in this Nova Roma, though those of Roma antiqua are particularly described by its historians, it makes such a conjecture highly improbable; besides, the harbour, as it is justly observed, with the grounds rising about it like an amphitheatre, would have formed a much more magnificent place for such an exhibition than any artificial one that could have been fabricated. As the aqueduct was raised by a prediction, these open cisterns were destroyed by one. A philosopher, says Cedrenus, assured the Emperor Heraelius that the water would fail if they continued as cisterns, so he ordered them to be filled up, and planted with trees. They are described by Chrysoloras and others as being thus treated, and so they remain at this day. They are places which produce fruits and vegetables in abundance. The deposits of the water had left a substratum of very rich mould, which is still highly fertile, and which the Turks cultivate. They call them Tchokour Bostan, or the Sunk Gardens.

<p>As water is a religious as well as a natural, want to a Turk, and he requires it for ablution as well as for drinking, he is still more anxious to preserve it than the Greeks; and though the mode of distributing it in the city adopted by the latter is not adhered to, their mode of conveying it thither has been carefully observed and improved upon. The Greek … is now called a bendt, and the number of them is greatly increased. Several have been formed by individuals, and retain their names. One of them is called the Valadi (*he means Valide) Bendt, because it was formed by the Sultana Valadi, the mother of the present Sultan. The front is an erection of abutments of solid masonry, built in rustic, surmounted by a balustrade, and ornamented with Turkish sculpture, among which is a marble tablet, with a Turkish inscription, intimating that it was erected in the year of the Hegira corresponding with our 1786. The walk along the summit is fine; it is a marble terrace, of near five hundred feet in lengthy flanked by balustrades. As you look over the balustrades, you see at one side a large triangular lake, rising to the level of your feet and extending between the hills till it terminates in a point up the valley. On the other side you see a perpendicular descent of one hundred and thirty feet into a dark ravine, along the sides of which the water is discharged in pipes to its destination. Several new aqueducts are also erected. One, bearing the name Solyman, is of vast size, consisting of two ranges of fifty arches, extending across a valley of sixteen hundred feet. But the most noble and conspicuous is that which is thrown across the valley of Buyukdere, and terminating the vista of that valley from the Bosphorus with its white arches. They are both part of that combination of levels which conveys the water of the bendts to the city, the former along the western bank of the Cydaris, through the Egri Kapoosi Gate, into Constantinople; the latter along the ridge over the Bosphorus, by the great burying-ground into the peninsula of Pera.
</p><p>But the Turks have improved and simplified the old system of aqueducts by a very ingenious contrivance. The first objects that struck my notice were long ranges of rude pyramidal columns, quite detached from each other and from everything else. I supposed they were large monuments, and looked up for some inscription, when suddenly a gush of water issued from the top, and was projected as if from the pipe of a water engine. I found that these were hydraulic pillars, called Sooteraisoo (*he means “su terazisi”), and were constructed in the following manner. At one side ascended a number of pipes conveying water, which was received into a square basin on the summit: this was divided by a partition perforated near the top, through which the water ran into the other compartment, leaving any impurities behind it in the first: from this it descended on the other side of the pillar by another set of pipes, which conveyed it to the next sooteraisoo, whose summit was a few inches lower than that of the former. In this manner the water is carried down an inclined plane, formed by the tops of these columns, and depositing its impurities in each of the reservoirs, till it enters the city. The force with which the fluid ascends is so great, that sometimes it forms a jet d'eau from the top falling in a shower all round for several yards. The practice has been found to answer so well, that it has been applied to the aqueduct of Valens in Constantinople, where I was surprised to find the abutments of the arches converted into sooteraisoos. You are surprised as I was to find so ingenious a device among the Turks — it is not their invention, but that of the scientific Arabians.
</p><p>Besides these conveyances above ground, the soil below is pierced by pits two or three hundred feet apart. These were excavated to facilitate the construction of tunnels through the hills to form water-courses.
</p><p>These pits, with various remains of tile tubes protruding from the ground in every direction in the lonely hills about the city, indicate the extensive and continued care taken at all times to supply this necessary element. From the spine of the ridge of high ground various courses branch off to the villages of the Bosphorus below, which are thus as well supplied with water as the capital; and at every convenient place is a fountain, generally faced with a marble slab, containing an inscription, acknowledging the bounty of Allah, and his providence, and frequently inviting the passenger who participates in the refreshment to participate also in gratefully acknowledging it. This fluid, so important to themselves, the Turks are anxious to extend to every living being; bowls of water are placed for their dogs, and even cavities are formed on tombs as reservoirs for birds, that every animal may participate in an element which they themselves so highly prize.
</p><p>To watch over its proper distribution, a numerous body of men are incorporated. The chief is called the Sou Nazir, or Water Inspector. Whenever a rupture or other impediment occurs to interfere with the due and regular distribution of the water, he is empowered to compel every one in the vicinity to assist in repairing a common injury, in which all are equally concerned, and he is responsible with his life that no interruption takes place in the daily current; even the Sultans are expected to make an annual inspection of their limits and state of repair. Besides these corps, there is the Sou Jolgee (*he means “suyolcu”), or Engineers, who periodically examine and calculate the water in the bendts. Before I went to Belgrade, the weather had been remarkably dry, so that, with the exception of a few passing showers, it had not rained from the 4th of April to the 2nd of November. The sou jolgee came out while I was there, and I accompanied them to the bendts. They measured the water, and found no more in the reservoirs than was sufficient to supply the city for fifteen days, at the usual consumption, and even that was becoming turbid and muddy. Prayers were offered up in all the mosques and dervishes were placed on all the hills to discover the approach of the expected rain. One of them I saw on the Jouchi Daghi (*he means “Yusa Dagi –located right across Buyukdere on the Anatolian side”) watching the Black Sea, and when he saw a black cloud rising from it which indicated rain he gave immediate notice of it, and it was hailed by the people as a providential deliverance.

<p>Belgrade, or rather Biel Gorod, is a Sclavonian word, and signifies the White Town, or Fortress: it is situated in the debouches of many of the valleys of the Low Balcan, which run southerly along the shores of the Black Sea. The present village is built near one extremity of the Great Reservoir, formed by the Greeks of the Lower Empire, where the water was collected from the various rills which wind through the sinuosities of the valleys, till they meet in a considerable stream between two hills. These are part of the chain of the Low Balcan, which is here crowned with magnificent forests of oak, chestnut, and other large trees. When I passed through them they exhibited a melancholy picture of devastation. After the discontented janissaries, and the rabble who united with them, were suppressed by the severe executions I have mentioned, a number of them escaped from the city. Some passed over to Scutari, and attempted to seize on the large barracks there, but were driven out with two pieces of cannon. They then dispersed; some retreated to the woods about Moudania, and some recrossed the Bosphorus, and, joined by others, established themselves in the woods about Belgrade, where they formed banditti in parties of eight or ten, issuing from the forests, plundering and murdering every traveller they met on the roads, and again retiring to the inaccessible recesses, where they could not be effectually pursued. After committing great depredations with impunity, and baffling the pursuit of every detachment sent against them, the government were obliged to have recourse to an expedient they were very reluctant to practise. The woods were not only the sources of water but of fire to the inhabitants of the city; they not only supplied the rills which filled the bendts, but the fuel used by the people, which was here cut and transported on rafts down the Bosphorus. But the depredations of these outlaws became so alarming, that no expedient was left but to bum them out of their fastnesses. Accordingly, the woods were set on fire by the Pasha, and the blaze illumined the Euxine. The robbers' were dislodged, and numbers of them shot by various parties who watched them as they issued from among the blazing forests, and tranquillity and security were again restored to the roads; but the beauty of the magnificent scenery was entirely destroyed. About Belgrade the fire extended for several miles square, denuding the hills and scorching the fair face of nature. The largest and most magnificent forest trees were burnt to the heart near the base; these becoming top heavy, fell over with a crash, and lay half consumed encumbering the ground, and obstructing the roads in all directions. The noble trees thus destroyed were generally chestnut, beech, oak, walnut, lime, and platanus, of a size and beauty unknown in England. In clambering through them, we discovered the decaying bodies of men and wild animals, particularly wild boars and bucks, with which these woods abound. They had either been overtaken by the fire or killed in attempting to escape from it; and thus the deepest recesses of the woods, as well as the crowded streets of the cities in this devoted country were filled with devastation and the destruction of life.
</p><p>Indeed, the hostility which seems to be declared against everything that can improve or ameliorate the condition of human life is everywhere displayed. The country between Constantinople and Belgrade is susceptible of the highest cultivation, wherever the woods do not extend; but it is not only waste, but the remnants of cultivation show that it has been once attempted, and abandoned as a thing utterly impracticable. Osman Aga, a director of the customs, was one of those precocious Turks who seemed to have anticipated his countrymen by a century in intelligence and a disposition to improve. He obtained a large chiflik, or grant of land here, and commenced agricultural experiments on a respectable scale. The face of the country was beginning to assume the aspect of that of a civilized people, and there was a distant hope that the example would extend, and the beautiful vicinity of Constantinople assume something of that character of cultivated nature which marks every Christian capital in Europe. In several places were seen insulated farms, surrounded by hedge-rows of trees, and displaying the richest verdure, like oases in the midst of a desert; in others the ground was already turned up and prepared for crops. He had besides built a large house in the midst of the solitude, in which he hoped to pass the last years of his life with his family, surrounded by his improvements. The year before, however, he was arrested and exiled into Asia, and his property confiscated. The only crime I ever heard attributed to him was, that he seemed growing too rich, and his improvements, imperfect as they were, held out an incentive to the cupidity of the government. His houses, as I passed, were neglected and already falling to decay; the numerous tenantry he was beginning to establish about him had abandoned his farms, and no one had enterprise or intelligence to retake them, and the whole was fast approaching to that state of waste and solitude from which he was beginning to reclaim it. In a ride of twelve miles from the capital, it was the only thing I met like an attempt at farming or agricultural improvements, with the exception of a few gardens.
</p><p>The situation of the village of Belgrade is very beautiful. The valley in which it stands is a level plain, covered with a fine verdant sward, and flanked by romantic wooded eminences, studded with beech trees, which had escaped the conflagration. Through the middle a pure stream winds its way, and after a course of two or three miles, empties itself into the artificial lake formed for a reservoir. In the year 1718 it was the favourite residence of the European ambassadors; and Lady Mary Wortley Montague dates some of her lively letters from it. No trace, however, of her description is to be found in the present aspect of the place. She describes it as commanding a view of the sea, and as the residence of all the opulent Franks, who met every evening at a fountain, and in the midst of fruit trees. It is now abandoned by every family of opulence, with the exception of one British merchant, in whose house I took up my residence. I searched in vain for a glimpse of the sea — the fountain has disappeared — and there is not a fruit-tree to be seen, except a vine in a vineyard. It was in vain to inquire for the house in which her Ladyship resided, as no trace of it was left in 1794, when Dallaway was chaplain at Constantinople, and the very tradition of it is now lost. It ought, however, to have been preserved, for it was here she inoculated her son, and so it was the spot from which the greatest and most valuable improvement in medical knowledge was conferred upon Europe, by disarming the most foul and loathsome disease that ever afflicted the human race of all its virulence.

<p>Among the objects of natural history which engaged my attention here were the flights of migratory birds, which at this season of the year darken the air, from the Black Sea across the woods. They frequently lighted on the summits of the highest trees, where Greek boys climbed up, and attaching various snares, continually brought down numbers. I was particularly attracted by one of them. It was a cross-bill (Loxia curvirostra), about the size of a large thrush. The colour of the male was red, inclining to brown, and of the female green, but the formation of the bill was singular: both mandibles were curved in the opposite direction, and crossed. It was difficult to conceive what nature meant by this apparently awkward and unmanageable construction. I soon, however, saw that she had done nothing in vain. I domesticated one of these birds, and it became as familiar as a parrot, sat on my shoulder while I wrote, and whistled to me for food. I discovered that it particularly frequented Turkish cemeteries, and was most commonly met with among the cypress trees. I collected, therefore, some of the cypress cones, and whenever he whistled I presented him with one. He took it with great dexterity in one of his claws, and holding it up, he hopped to his perch on the other leg. He then split open with his cross-beak the tough divisions of the cone with a force, and got out the seeds with a dispatch that mandibles of any other construction could never accomplish. I kept this familiar and interesting bird for several months, till a rapacious kite, hovering over the palace garden, made a stoop, and destroyed it. I called it Ne^ ov^roXi, its modern Greek name, and it answered to the sound by a whistle.
</p><p>The Turks, I found, had prohibited, under the severest penalties, any one in this neighbourhood to dig up trees or sink pits, by which the water might escape or ooze out, or plant gardens, by which it might be exhausted. I was obliged therefore to procure an express firman for the first purpose, and with an injunction that I should not approach the bendts. I used my permission with due discretion, and after dispatching several loads of young trees to Pera, I was compelled to follow them by the severity of the weather.
</p>

<p>Note: During the plague in Istanbul (probably the last plague, which was in 1836-1837):
</p><p>When he was removed there was a general expulsion from the Palace of all who were known to have touched him, and they proceeded to different places to keep quarantine. I with others went to Belgrade, to the house of Mr. Black, a British merchant, who was so good as to offer it for our accommodation. The generous man told me he had no concern but about us, though our occupation of it might eventually cause the abandonment of the house and the destruction of all its costly furniture. On my way I called at Buyukdere on Baron Miltitz, the Prussian Ambassador, a friendly man, and intimate with Lord Strangford; and as it was not improbable that I might carry the infection with me, I agreed with him to send my young charge to him, in the event of my taking ill.
</p><p>For two days we all continued well, and the alarm was beginning to subside. Tartars were attending on horseback, and bulletins of health were constantly dispatched backwards and forwards from Belgrade to Pera; but on the third day I felt nausea and headache, with other febrile symptoms, which I thought suspicious, so I despatched a Tartar to Baron Miltitz to inform him of the fact. When this transpired, the alarm, which before, though great, was vague, was now brought home to the bosoms of all the compromised party. One of us was supposed to have actually taken the complaint, and the rest hourly expected it. Again they became fugitives from the dreadful disorder, and attempted to fly from that which they apprehended they carried about them. My first anxiety was to send away my dear young friend. Seeing me ill, he affectionately followed me, and wished to take my hand, but I felt intense anxiety at the thoughts of touching him, so I availed myself of the flight of my companions to have him conducted to Buyukdere. It will hardly be believed that the child was abandoned on the road to the care of a janissary, who brought him at near midnight to the residence of the Prussian Ambassador.
</p><p>I now found myself utterly alone, deserted by all the world, in a solitary spot among woods and mountains. In this state of dismal desolation I thought of those unfortunate persons who, on the first appearance of certain diseases in the time of darkness and ignorance, were shut out in some lonely place, and left to perish or recover by themselves. I had once felt what it was to suppose I was doomed to die by an earthquake, and I now felt a no less awful sensation of dying of the plague, and being found dead by the next person who came near me. While these thoughts crowded on my mind I felt a delirium and stupor coming over me, and, after vain attempts to rouse myself and bear up against it, I fell on the grass in a state of insensibility.
