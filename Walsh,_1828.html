<p>The bridge over which we passed is near the junction of two small streams, which unite at this place, and fall into the head of the harbour, called by the ancients, from the accumulation of filth always deposited there, the Marcidium Mare, or Putrid Sea*. These streams were anciently named the Cydaris and Barbyses; the first is now called the Ali Bey Sou, and the last the Kyat-khana Sou, because it supplied the paper-mill. As these are the only rivulteswhich flow near the city, and supply a very scanty current of water at any time, but in summer are nearly altogether dry, and as the soil of the city affords but little water from springs, - it would have been quite impossible for a large city to exist in this spot, if some artificial means had not been devised to supply the deficiencies of nature. The first of these means are cisterns and wells, constructed at the bottoms of the houses, as reservoirs, to save the rain-water that falls in winter; but to a people like the Turks, to whom water is religious as well as a natural want, and who use it for ablution as well as drinking, it was necessary to have a much more abundant source of supply; and this is found in the bendts or tanks which they have constructed in the mountains, near the shores of the Black Sea. These mountains are the regions of streams and showers; and wherever a small rill is found running into a valley on any elevation, a mound is raised across the lower end, and the water thus obstructed is thrown back and accumulated, till it forms a large, deep, triangular lake. This mound is generally faced with marble, covered with sculptures of oriental device, and has a very grand and magnificent appearance. Pipes formed of tiles, moulded into tubes, convey the water along the hills, and when a valley interposes, it is crossed by an aqueduct, some of which are very striking and noble in perspective.
</p><p>They have latterly, however, had a glimmering of hydrostatics: and instead of expensive bridges, to convey the water on a summit level, they erect Sou-terasi; that is, square detached pillars on their construction, -several tile pipes are attached to the surface and rise to the top, on which there is a small square reservoir; the water ascends on one side, is received into the reservoir, and descends by the pipes on the other: the next pillar is six inches lower, and so there is an inclined plane formed for the water on the tops of these pillars from the mountains to the city, where it sometimes ascends with such force, that it forms a strong jet d'eau, which scatters it to a considerable distance. These pillars are very curious-looking and unaccountable objects, till you're apprised of their use; and they are dispersed all over the country, from near the Black Sea to Constantinople. In a century more the Turks will find out that even these can be dispensed with, and water will find its own level in tubes across a valley, without their assistance.
</p><p>The bendts, or reservoirs of water in the mountains, were originally constructed by the Greek Emperors, when the capital of the Roman empire was transferred to Byzantium, and the great increase of population required a more abundant supply of water. They were called , and their preservation was denied of such importance, that several edicts on the subject were issued by different emperors, many of which are yet extant; some regulating the planting of trees, others prohibiting the abstraction of water for private use, and one, issued in the year 404, fixes the penalty of a pound of gold for every ounce of water! These laws have been re-enacted even with more rigour by the Turks, as water is more necessary to them than to the Greeks. The embankments are planted with trees, to make them more firm and secure; and they prohibit, under the severest penalties, any person, not only from taking water from a bendt, but from cutting or digging up a tree on its borders.
</p><p>The necessity for this strictness you will judge of from the following fact. I passed the autumn of 1822 at Belgrade, in the vicinity of which is situated one of the largest and most important of these reservoirs. the summer had been remarkably dry, and it appeared, from a meteorological table which I kept, that it had not rained from the 4th of April to the 2nd of November, with the exception of a few passing showers. The water in the bendts became low and muddy, and the Turks took the alarm. The Sou-ioldge, or water engineers, were sent out, and I accompanied them to some of the bendts: they measured the quantity of the water, and they found no more than sufficient to supply the city for fifteen days! Judge of the consternation of 700,000 persons, suddenly deprived of an element essential not only for domestic but religious uses, and having no other possible mode of obtaining it. Prayers were offered up in the mosques, and the sky was anxiously watched. The immutability of things in the East, and the illustrations they give to the writings of former times, is not the least pleasure a person experiences in these countries. The approach of rain is always indicated here, as it was in Syria, by the appearance of a small, dark, dense, circumscribed cloud, hanging over either the Euxine or the Propontis. A dervish stands on the top of the Jouchi-daghi, or Giant's Mountain; and when he sees a cloud, he announces its approach, like Elijah from the top of Mount Carmel. I one day climbed to the same place, and saw the dervish on the watch, and "I looked towards the sea and beheld a little cloud rising out of the sea, like a man's hand, and gat me down that the rain stopped me not." In effect, it immediately followed, and the Turks were relieved from a very serious cause of anxiety.
</p><p>In order to provide against such a privation, either by nature or an enemy, the Greek emperors excavated the city, and formed immense cisterns in different places; to these the aqueducts led the water of the bendts, and they were always kept full. The most striking object in Constantinople is the aqueduct of Emperor Valens, streching from hill to hill across the city, and supplying the cisterns; it is the only one remaining of several described by historians, and as its origin is curious I will mention it. The Emperor, incensed at the conduct of people of Chalcedon, who had favoured the party of Procopius, ordered their walls to be pulled down. Among the stones was found one with an oracular inscription, implying that "the walls of Chalcedon would bring a great supply of water to the city;" and to complete the prophecy, Valens erected his aqueduct with the materials. I often searched for this prophetic stone on the aqueduct, but could not find it. The streets in some places lead through it, in others run alongside of it. Vines and a variety of trailing plants have established themselves in the interstices of the stones; and as their roots are supplied with the water which oozes out, they hang down with great luxuriance and beauty.
