<p>Therapia and Buyoukdereh are unlike all the other villages on the Bosphorus. They are periodically swinging back and forth from populous activity to dreariness and desertion. In winter they are most uninviting habitations, incessantly scourged by merciless blasts from the Black Sea. With the coming of spring, they banish their desolation. Doors, closed and barred for months. are thrown wide open. The tide of human beings begins its impetuous flow to them from Pera and Galata. Every summer embassy, hotel, and private dwelling bubbles with new-come, overflowing life. The quay, the water, the balconies, the drawing-rooms, are surrendered to emulous display of gayety and fashion, hut all of the monotonous European type, with no personality of its own. Yet. though the costume is Parisian, it is a most cosmopolitan assembly that puts it on.
</p><p>Therapia bends like a crescent around its bay. The German, French, Italian, and British embassies are at short distances from one another, near the shore. The British Embassy is an edifice of indescribable architectural
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="184">184</span></h2>
<p>design, overhung by a giant rock and a forest-covered hill, built on the most conspicuous and wind-swept point of the upper Bosphorus. The house, the third from it on the north, quaint in appearance, with ivied terraces and splendid trees, was the summer residence of General and Mrs. Lew Wallace. Greek, Catholic, and Protestant churches alternate with one another.
</p><p>Till long after Christ the name of the village was Pharmakia, the Place of Drugs or Poisons, —a reminder of the Argonauts and Medea. According to tradition, Medea having safely arrived thus far in her flight with Jason from Colchis, deemed her box of drugs no longer necessary, and threw it away. The goodly Patriarch Attikos, in the fifth century, was scandalized that a place of so salubrious air should be burdened with an ill-omened and pagan name. "Let it Le called Place of Healing," he said, and so it has been to this day. It is the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Derkon, who bears the sounding title of "Very Reverend Lord of the Bosphorus and of the Cyanean Isles".
</p><p>The boundary between Therapia and Buyoukdereh is marked by Kiredj Bournou, the Lime Cape, beak, despite its refreshing plane-trees. From it, through the hills. one catches his first glimpse of the dread Black Sea. To friendly mariners upon that sea, Kiredj Bournou flashes a welcome from its lighthouse, and for foes it has a warning ready in its battery of fourteen guns. To the left, on the cliff above, are the remains of a village, its history lost and forgotten, abandoned centuries ago. On the right, in the water, might be seen till recently the boulder, Dikaia Petra, the Just Rock, of whose intelligence and integrity the sailors to this day narrate marvellous tales.
</p><p>The northern winds with unobstructed fury batter the

<p>abrupt, bald hillside. The dreary road continues along the~ quay, past the. long-since ruined Church of Saint Euphemia; past Table Rock, dear to fishermen; past Aghatch Alti, with its six trees and six cannon; past the hamlet of Kepheli, with its memories of Crimean exiles. At last, in the depth of the bay, it attains the wide meadow, Buyoukdereh, the Great Valley, beyond which lies the village of that name.
</p><p>This meadow was beloved by the ancient and mediæval Byzantines. Their imagination bestowed upon it many endearing names, almost all commencing with Broad or Deep. To the common husbandman it is still pre-eminently the Good Field, because of its fertility. This valley was a frequent and favorite camping-ground of the Crusaders. Near the middle is a monumental plane-tree, or rather a gigantic clustre of plane-trees, all nourished
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="186">186</span></h2>
<p>by a single root. Botanis1ts assert that it has been growing more than nine hundred years. Europeans give it the name, "Plane-tree of Godfrey of Bouillon," from the tradition that this Sir Galahad of chivalry planted it with his knightly hand when bivouacking in this plain with his cross-hearing host. The fairest of historians, Anna Komnena, who was then alive, distinctly states, however, that Godfrey never encamped here, but that his brother Crusader, Count Raoul of Flanders, did, with an army of ten thousand men. The Ottomans name it Kirk Aghatch, the Forty Trees; and Yedi Karindash, the Seven Brothers. They say the last was first employed by Achmet I in memory of his own dead brothers. Under this tree, in 1807, Kabatchioglou and five hundred desperate men formed the conspiracy which resulted four days later in the deposition of Selim III, and the enthronement of Moustapha IV.
</p><p>Westward may be seen the graceful aqueduct of Mahmoud I. Following the road which winds inland toward the northwest, one reaches the great forest of Belgrade. There are the water-sources and the bends, or natural reservoirs, whence has been slaked the thirst of the capital through so many centuries. There are the hamlets and villages, lost and hidden in the woods, that charmed the fancy of always charming Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. There is the historic settlement of Belgrade, peopled by the unwilling exiles who were brought hither by Souleyman the Magnificent, after his capture of the Servian capital. The south part of the village of Buyoukdereh is inhabited by Armenians. Greeks, Ottomans, and Jews. North of the steamer landing, it is mainly given up to European foreigners. Every Oriental feature seems eliminated. Its
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="187">187</span></h2>
<p>spacious quay, its stately mansions, its thoroughly western air, stamp it with an individuality of its own. Partly sheltered by the hill, less racked than Therapia by the never-ceasing northern wind, yet always the beneficiary of the delicious coolness, it is in summer the most delightful habitation on the Bosphorus. Justinian erected here a church to Saint Theodore of Tyrone, in which for generations the emperors worshipped on the first Sunday in Lent. It possessed a monastery of the Holy Martyrs, built, in 803, by Saint Tarasios, “the most holy and most orthodox," in which he was himself buried. In it the Emperor Leo V confined the Empress Prokopia and her two daughters, after he had robbed their husband and father, Michael I, of the throne. The modern church of the Armenians is consecrated to Saint Hcripsima, one of the glorious women of their national history. She preferred martyrdom to a crown which might have been hers, had she accepted marriage with a pagan king. In a kiosk in the garden of the Austrial Embassy, Thomas Hope composed his romance,
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="188">188</span></h2>
<p>"Anastasius, or the Memoirs of a Modern Greek," which created an excitement in the literary world seventy-five years ago. The Russian Embassy is the farthest north of all the summer ambassadorial structures. It is simple, symmetrical, and elegant. The dark hill and forest behind add to its effectiveness, and make its proportions stand out in graceful relief. Marion Crawford spent many months near by in a romantic kiosk, that seems pendent upon the hill. There he wrote "The American Politician" and "Paul Patoff," and meanwhile, best of all, won his beautiful bride.
</p><p>Buyoukdereh ends at Mezar Bournou, the Cape of the Tomb. A sombre title well befits the spot, for the outlook from it is grand and solemn. The opposite Asiatic shore is bare and gaunt, and on the European side human habitations seem left behind. Here in classic times a statue of Aphrodite Pandemos rose above the water, doubtless the offering to her patron goddess of the Megarian Simaithra, a lady equally fair and frail. The name of the quiet inland quarter, Bulbul Mahalleh, the Village of the Nightingales, is appropriate in its suggestiveness of melody and rest. Farther in are Sari Yer, the Yellow Place, where a persistent English company have sunk an untold amount of gold in digging after copper; and Kastaneh Son, the Chestnut Spring, —an Oriental Eden of chestnut groves and crystal brooks and perfect peace.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="189">189</span></h2>
<p>Still farther north, adventurous Greeks have perched Yeni Mahalleh, the New Village, upon the hills. It is set in a framework of clayey cliffs, and surrounded by a high built wall, that the rushing torrents of winter may not wash it away. Enterprise has planted the garden of Bella Vista in a situation glorious as an ayry. Somewhere here stood the temples of Rhea and Apollo, afterwards, on their sites, the churches of the Holy Virgin and Saint Nicholas&#160;; but all vestiges of church and temple are equally gone.
</p><p>Northward from this point both the European and Asiatic banks show visible and continuous marks of volcanic origin. The plateau west of Yeni Mahalleh is described by Choiseul Gouffier as "a veritable Phlegrean plain, the burned soil of which presents traces of numerous little craters, once breathing-holes of subterranean fires, which have calcined all this region, and reduced the greater part of the soil to a real pozzolana."
</p><p>Fortifications, antiquated and abandoned, and modern earthworks, glistening with the newest cannon, succeed one another at every advantageous point as far as the Black Sea. The earlier are entirely the work of the Ottomans, erected in that proud day when for war and battle the Ottoman looked only to himself. Then comes the later period when French engineers, De Tott, Toussaint, Meunier, and their fellow-countrymen, planned and supervised the construction of every fortress. Their defences, superseded in the march of change, are now patched and utilized, — worn-out military garments mended with new cloth. To this class belongs the renovated semi-hexagonal stone fortress of Telli Tabia, with its twenty-four guns, near Yeni Mahalleh. Most recent of all are the earthworks, so constantly modified, or "strengthened and extended," that their chronic condition is incompletion.
</p><p>From an early period in their history, the Ottomans have placed a peculiar, almost superstitious, reliance in the possession of artillery. They believe to-day that their capital is impregnable. Their confidence might be justified if there were no other military road to Constantinople than down their narrow strait. The frequency of earthworks
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="190">190</span></h2>
<p>in the upper Bosphorus and the multitude of guns behind them constitutes a formidable show. To estimate the real efficiency of these defences in some possible future war, numerous other factors must be taken into account.
</p><p>The hamlet of Roumeli Kavak, the European Poplar, is the most northern station served by the local steamers. The tiny village is a growth around the stone fortress, erected in 1628 by Mourad IV, to prevent further incursions of the Cossacks. Two years before, like birds of prey, a horde of that savage people had swooped down over the Black Sea, in a hundred and fifty of their broad flat-bottomed boats, and had sacked and burned every settlement on the Bosphorus as far as Boadjikeui. The fortress was rebuilt to the sound of drum and fife in 1890.
</p><p>Such sudden raids by their northern neighbors were through the Middle Ages the dread of the Byzantine emperors. On the top of the hill behind Roumeli Kavak, they built a powerful castle, with a thick, high wall, descending from it to the shore. Thence a mole of adequate proportions was prolonged part way across the strait, and a chain stretched from it to the Asiatic bank. A like wall ascended the opposite Asiatic hill to an even stronger castle. Thus the entrance was effectually closed against attack by sea. The whole outline of these mediaeval ramparts can be traced, and the still standing ruins of the castles, especially on the Asiatic side, are majestic. Part of the mole has been destroyed or washed away; but as one glides over it in a boat, he can discern its entire form, surprisingly preserved, in the transparent water. Its eastern end, where the chain was fastened, is indicated by a buoy.
</p><p>Here, too, are the yet existing remains of the artificial harbor, where, during the days of the Byzantine Empire,
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="192">192</span></h2>
<p>all vessels, inward or outward bound, anchored and paid toll. It is a curious example of the tenacity of tradition that the Ottomans, who themselves had no personal acquaintance with the spot, call these scattered rocks Gumrouk Iskelessi, the Custom-House Pier.
</p><p>Somewhere in the vicinity, in different ages, were reared three structures of surpassing splendor, — the Temple of the Byzantines, the Serapeion, and the imperial Church of the Incorporeals .. The first grew from a votive altar, attributed to Jason, and its memory is preserved by Strabo; the second is immortalized by Polybios; the third, reerected and re-enriched from age to age, was at last torn down by Mohammed II, to be built into his fortress of Roumeli Hissar. The site of them all is absolutely lost. But the fishers' perches, the daghlians, lift their fantastic forms above the water, as like daghlians have risen over the same wavy spot through thousands of years. Though the storied temples on the shore are gone, these most rustic fabrics of the simplest human craft remain in grotesque possession of the bay.
</p><p>In a sequestered vale close by, north of the Ottoman battery of Siralache, is the Holy Fountain of the Virgin, the Mauromoliotissa. The ground in the vicinity is thickly strewn with ruins. A place so isolated and austere appealed to the ascetic devotion of the Middle Ages as a most appropriate site for a religious retreat. There in the eleventh century, the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Constantine XI, and afterwards of his successor Romanos IV Diogenes, founded the Monastery of the Holy Virgin, the Mauromoliotissa. In 1071, her second husband, heroic, but ill-fated, after a reign that is a romantic tragedy, lost his crown and life. The only refuge open to the dethroned Empress was this monastery. There her head
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="193">193</span></h2>
<p>was shorn of the long silken tresses of which, in brighter days, she had been so proud, and was wrapped round with the coarse black veil of a Basilian nun. There she passed the last twenty-six years of her checkered life. There she composed the work on history and mythology which seems almost fragrant from her touch, and which she entitled "Ionia, or the Bed of Violets." The monastery was renowned for the saintliness of its inmates.
</p><p>"She
</p><p>Dwelt with them, till in time their Abbess died.
</p><p>Then she, for her good deeds and her pure life,
</p><p>And for the power of ministration in her,
</p><p>And likewise for the high rank she had borne,
</p><p>Was chosen Abbess: There, an Abbess lived,
</p><p>and there, an Abbess, past
</p><p>To where beyond these voices there is peace."
</p><p>In a subsequent century it was abandoned by the nuns and appropriated by monks. At the universal overthrow of 1453, two monastic cells escaped destruction, and were tenanted by successive hermits until 1713. That year, having without express permission dared to rebuild their chapel, which had fallen down, they roused the fierce anger of the fanatic Grand Vizir, Damat Ali Pasha; the recluses were put to death, and the cells and chapels demolished. The death, full of suffering, of their persecutor a few years later was considered by the Christians the punishment of his crime. The place is sacred in the affections of the Greeks. Annually, on the fourth of September, they throng the deserted vale with that strange blending of religious fervor and gayety which characterizes Eastern piety. The chanted prayers of the priest, and the ringing voices of children, wake alternate echoes in
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="194">194</span></h2>
<p>the spot, silent and sepulchral as the grave, on every other day throughout the year.
</p><p>Not far distant is the Chrysorrhoas, the Golden Stream, in whose bed it is asserted may be found sands of gold. At its mouth the Thracians reaped a rich, but infamous Bay of Buyouk Liman harvest, with false lights alluring incoming vessels to destruction. The inhospitable Bay of Buyouk Liman, the Great Harbor, now commanded by a frowning battery, is the ancient anchorage of the Ephesians, — vessels from the opulent city of Diana having the immemorial custom of mooring here.
</p><p>The whole European shore above Roumeli Kavak is not so much the domain of history as the realm of the two brother antiquaries, — the student of geology and the lover of myths.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="195">195</span></h2>
<p>It consists of a precipitous, rocky cliff, destitute of verdure, but of a greenish tint, and only at rare intervals intersected by a ravine. Millions of rounded stones and rocks are set in its face, apparently clinging by some invisible attraction, and ready to fall. As one passes in a boat under its threatening brow, he almost hesitates to approach too near for fear of the waiting avalanche. Yet to dislodge the smallest pebble is not easy, so firmly is it held in the adamantine grip of the hardened mass. Dr. Clarke, the erudite Professor of Mineralogy at Cambridge, England, calls the whole "a remarkable aggregation of enormous pebble stones, of heterogeneous masses of mineral substances, polished by the friction of the waters, and enclosed in a coarse, natural cement.. .. These substances had first undergone the violent action of fire, and afterwards, in consequence of their long submersion under water, that sort of friction to which they owe their present form."
</p><p>Tasalandjik Bournou, the Cape of Rocks, was the ancient Aphrodision. At its foot lay a safe and sheltered harbor, from which, up winding, narrow paths among the frightful cliffs. Aphrodite called the storm-tossed mariners to the waiting welcome of votaries in her temple. Near the harbor rose the Generous Rock, so called in irony from the ships to which it had given destruction, and from the human beings to whom it had given death. To them who had scaled the height, now in the intoxication of rest, with the awful Euxine beyond, and spectral death escaped below, —
</p><p>"Most weary seemed the sea, weary the oar,
</p><p>Weary the wandering fields of barren foam."
</p><p><br />
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="196">196</span></h2>
<p>Pappas Boumou, the Cape of the Priest, concealed Panion, the Grotto of Pan. Over it lowered, as lowers to-day, an enormous mass, thousands of tons in weight, threatening through thousands of years its imminent fall. Within were seats in the natural rock, the home of the nymphs and of the great god Pan. The seats and the overhanging mass are there, but Pan and his nymphs are gone, and an Ottoman battery holds their place.
</p><p>Somewhere on the European bank, near the mouth of the Bosphorus, were the court of the blind soothsayer, Phineus, and the haunts of the Harpies, his hideous tormentors. Apollonios, the Rhodian, narrates the legend with most minute detail. The moment a morsel of food approached the lips of Phineus, the Harpies rushed from their lurking-places and snatched it away, meanwhile defiling the ground with their horrid droppings and the air with a loathsome stench. Their victim was cursed with immortality. His skin, drawn tightly over his bones by utter emaciation, prevented their falling apart. The oracle had foretold that the Argonauts were to release him from his tormentors, and also that from him Jason was to obtain such counsels as would enable him to pass the hitherto impassable Cyanean Rocks .
</p><p>These two islands, placed as guardians on opposite sides of the Bosphorus, always swung together and crushed between them whatever endeavored to enter the Black Sea. Then they instantly swung back to their original position. If any living thing once got through in safety, they were henceforth to be immovable forever. On their arrival, two of the Argonautic heroes, Zethes and Calais, the winged sons of Boreas, put the Harpies to flight. They were about to destroy the foul monsters, but Iris, the messenger of Zeus, descended from the sky, and swore by
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="197">197</span></h2>
<p>the river Styx that they should never come back. When Phineus had appeased the hunger of years, he gave his benefactors so shrewd advice as fully repaid his debt. He bade Jason advance the " Argo " as near as possible to the line the Rocks would traverse, and then to let loose a dove from the vessel's prow&#160;; then instantly, as they flew apart after crushing the feeble prey, to row the "Argo" boldly forward, and thus pass before the Rocks had time to dash together in a second collision. Jason implicitly followed the counsel. The dove was an efficacious sacrifice; but so rapid was the ovement of the Rocks that, though the "Argo" itself passed unharmed, her rudder was caught in the angry clash. One part of the seer's advice was perhaps the most valuable of all. Said he, Do your utmost with your oars and sails; count more upon your arms than upon the prayers which you offer the gods." The conditions of the oracle had been fulfilled. Living heroes had passed unscathed between the jaws of danger; "hence," as Apollonios says, "the islands have been stable ever since."
</p><p>With one of the ancient monuments of the Bosphorus, Fable and Tradition have associated the name of Ovid, their most brilliant master. Though the banished poet passed through the strait on his way to exile, there is no evidence that he ever touched its shores. Nevertheless, a high, circular stone pile, long since abandoned of inhabitant, prominent on the height of Karibdjeh, is still called Ovid's Tower. It is a pleasing coincidence that, some years ago, this tower was pointed out to that prince of modem fabulists, Hans Christian Andersen, as the six months' residence of Ovid, prince of the fabulists of Rome .
</p><p>Phanaraki, the Lighthouse, is the last settlement on the European shore of the Bosphorus. Its magnificent
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="198">198</span></h2>
<p>beacon-light is visible eighteen miles out at sea. The inhabitants of the village are mostly Christians. So strongly is their influence felt that even the ordinary language of the Ottoman residents is Greek. By a custom of former days, still frequently observed, every person on entering the Euxine threw into the water a piece of money as propitiatory offering. Gradually Christian observances have supplanted pagan usage, and the little church of Phanaraki is constantly sought by sailors offering their thanksgivings for dangers escaped, and their petitions against dangers to come.
</p><p>Kilia, the headquarters of the Black Sea life-boat service, is not situated upon the Bosphorus, but five miles west, on the craggy shore of the Black Sea. Nevertheless, it is connected with the Bosphorus by even more vital associations than any mere geographical tie. Hundreds of human beings, shipwrecked while seeking the elusive mouth of the strait, have been torn from otherwise certain death by the devotion and daring of the members of this life-saving service. The student and the tourist, rapt in contemplation of classic myths and shadowy history, often forget modern heroism. Our Anglo-Saxon names are less euphonious than the vowel-fluted names of ancient and Southern tongues. Among all the figures which have immortalized the Bosphorus, there are none more associate with humanity and honor than those of Palmer and Summers, the captains of this philanthropic company, and of their brave associates.
