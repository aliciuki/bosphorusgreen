<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="349">349</span></h2>
<p>A series of beautiful valleys of Buyukdere are vividly drawn among the green shadows of its endless gardens. The shores of Europe and Asia no longer obscure the desolate horizon of the Black Sea; the strait, flowing a few more miles in a straight direction, finally takes the form of a mythological dragon, which, after its long bends, stretched its endless mouth into the vastness of the sea, yawns and greedily inhales its moist freshness. Until now, beautiful suburbs, palaces, fountains, groves, gardens, cemeteries looked out from both banks in its waters, and when the two banks merged into one strip, the sea took the form of a magical lake. All of this has been replaced a wild decoration of rocks and cogwheels and batteries, between which they took refuge: fishing huts or a wretched village. Buyukdere lies at the turn of two landscapes so different from each other, like the last smile of the Bosphorus, which leaves its pampered clothes to meet the sea rushing into it, as it came out of the hands of nature, stern and courageous.
</p><p>Here a wide and safe bay is formed, in which the Turkish fleet usually gathers before sailing to the Black Sea. At the beginning of the last war, several extra ships were delivered along the European coast, old ones that could not withstand the sea, but in the form of floating batteries were supposed to protect the strait from our fleet. The captain-pasha, who then commanded the fleet, the one who so stubbornly defended Varna later, was elevated to this dignity, having never served at sea. But he decided to educate sailors from that bastard with which ships are usually stuffed at the opening of a war. Faithful shoemakers, tailors, artisans of all kinds had to run around the shrouds from morning till night, learn from the cannons and do all the ship's anchorage maneuvers. By this, they only excited the smile of their compatriots, who looked at them from the shore and compared them with monkeys. Five years later, the Turks, with their little talk of "Mashallah", saw at this very place those ships that had recently been feared to visit and which had saved the capital from enemies and riots.
</p><p>The flags of almost all European powers are waving along the embankment. These are the houses of the ambassadors, bearing the famous name of palaces in Turkey. They lined up in one line on the embankment of the diplomatic suburb.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="350">350</span></h2>
<p>Music plays in the evenings on our frigate, and the coast is lively with groups of people walking. But the best promenade in Buyukdere is the valley, the largest and most picturesque of the fifty Bosfor valleys and from which the suburb got its name Big Valley, Buyukdere. The Byzantines called this place the Deep Bay or the Great Field. The mountains, covered with gardens and vineyards, formed a blooming belt, among which a sea of ​​greenery spilled out. In the depths of the spacious perspective, the arcades of the Roman aqueduct are drawn, as if the windows from which the purple tops of the Thracian mountains look out into the valley, into the Bosphorus and into the distant coast of Asia Minor. In the middle of the valley stands a tree, one of the wonders of the Bosphorus and of its historical monuments. It, perhaps, is older than Constantinople itself and, like it, has undergone the destructive effects of time. Thunderstorms struck the giant of the valley more than once; it retains only a third of its branches, but even now it surprises with its immensity. If you look closely at the shape of its roots, you will easily recognize that this is not one tree: accidentally or deliberately planted in a circle, seven plane trees have grown together at their roots, covered with one bark and made up one tree of incredible thickness. I didn’t measure its circumference, but I only know that. On horseback, I rode into its hollow, which is about three square fathoms of space and sometimes serves as a refuge for shepherds, sometimes a coffee house. The Turks call it one-kardash, seven brothers, from seven trees that have grown together as a brother. Western Europeans gave it the name Gottfried of Bouillon, based on the legend that under this plane tree the tent of the crusader leader was laid out. Anna Komnina says, however, that Komes Gontofre (as she calls Count Gottfried, once forever renouncing in her notes the claims to the correct pronunciation of the barbarian names of knights) was camped far from this place, at Cosmidion, the present Eyyub. A detachment of the French crusader Count Raoul de Saint-Caen was stationed in the buyukdere valley. We will not enter into critical studies of this circumstance, but we willingly recognize the noble plane tree as a monument of the crusading leaders on the shores of the Bosphorus, and if our imagination preserves its flame, which, in a wandering through places rich in historical memories, pours new light on objects, we can dream in the hour of evening twilight, that in the colossal shadow of the plane tree, the colossal shadows of the heroes who dedicated their life to the coffin of the God-man roam. What a majestic spectacle this valley, strewn with tents of knights, will present to us, revived by the nomadic population of Europe, which roused itself at the appeal of the inspired hermit, dressed in her heavy armor and under the cross, and with a staff of arms, and with a knightly sword, summoned old Asia to battle! Memories of European romanticism combined on the Bosphorus with the first memories of the romanticism of ancient Greece: the shadows of the knights of the cross walk hand in hand over this coast with the heroic shadows of the Argonauts. Both were tormented by a thirst for exploits and adventures, and both were attracted to a country, distant and unfamiliar, a land of magic and hostile forces, but instead of the golden fleece, Christian knights saw in the prospect of hard work and dangers the shrine of the tomb and the crown of martyrdom.&#160;
</p><p>The ghosts of knightly antiquity were scattered in my evening walk by the buyukdere ladies, who rushed past me on horseback at full speed along the valley.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="351">351&#160;</span></h2>
<p>If it were not for the groups of Muslims under a tree, not for a Turkish horseman riding his stallion in the valley, and not for a cart drawn by bulls in which Turkish women slowly trudge along the Belgrade road, you could imagine yourself in the vicinity of some European capital. Buyukdere is indeed a brilliant colony of our capitals. The descendants of the knights who were going to fight the infidels on the shores of the Bosphorus now visit them, write notes, give diplomatic dinners. The Best Society of Pera, a society of ambassadors and wealthy European merchants, spends the summer months in Terapye and Buyukdere. Balls, musical evenings, whist, festivities - all this in exactly the same order as in the highest circle of the entire educated world, and the gossip is the same. Only performances are not enough to have a full set of pleasures and entertainment in our windy Europe among the people who more often look at all this with contempt than with envy. In Buyukdere you will see very few Turks, and almost no Turkish families. The Greeks and Armenians living here, for the most part, adopted European customs, and if the fathers and mothers still retain their old costumes, then the youth, the zealous champion of novelty, dressed in European dress, and at the festivities, instead of annoying veils, you already see full, fresh and pretty faces buyukdere nymphs. Wide, spreading turbans of multi-colored gas retain something else national; but in recent years many young women have replaced turbans with hats or go about with their heads open, sporting a fluffy headdress of hair. The women of Constantinople have every right to be proud of their hair and now it is still naps. From the Byzantine chronicle that during the siege of the city, I don’t know by what enemies, women's hair saved the fatherland: the Byzantine fleet was inactive because of the lack of ropes; the patriots decided to cut off their braids, to make of them a sufficient supply of ropes, with which the fleet was armed and defeated the enemies. Perhaps from that time the Greek and Russian proverb "hang by a thread" was introduced, although scientists ‘assure that it is based on the legend of the sword of Damocles.
</p><p>In addition to the fresh sea air, which is so pleasant after the stuffy Pera, Buyukdere has for the traveler, who is not quite accustomed to the lifestyle on the Bosphorus, the benefit of not being taken here in the evenings to the cemetery; and I confess, no matter how picturesque the cemeteries of Constantinople, but walks in them leave some kind of sad impression on the soul, and I prefer to look at them from the sea, as at pictures, than to wander among the coffins and the aroma of cypress trees, from which you will get a migraine. Between Terapye and Buyukdere, in a secluded bay, under the plane trees, there is a fountain. This place is called Kirej-burnu, the Lime Cape, although there is no cape here. The inhabitants of the two suburbs join here in the evenings, and hunters can at any time find a pipe and coffee in a small gazebo, a necessary accessory for a fountain, shade and a picturesque horizon. On the other side of Buyukdere, closer to the Black Sea, one of the most charming locations of the Bosphorus is hidden behind the mountains. The Turks call it Kastaniye-soyu, Chestnut water, from a source that gushes from the mountain among chestnut trees. The Europeans called it the Valley of Roses from the many rose bushes that overgrown the surrounding area; and this name is perfectly in the spirit of the East and poetic names that indescribably elevate the charm of the location.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="352">352&#160;</span></h2>
<p>None of the Bosphorus valleys does not breathe such numbness; it is shielded by mountains from the sea, so that the gaze does not wander into the distant horizon, which inspires the soul with the desire for nomadic will; the valley lovingly coiled around the spring and roses, as the soul coils in the hours of quiet solitude in a circle of beloved thought. When the sea is agitated and rustling, only the dying voice of the coast reaches this mysterious valley, which the Bosphorus nightingales have chosen as their refuge. Here you can listen to them throughout the summer, and when their song is overflowing in the shade filled with the scent of roses, you can imagine yourself in the valley where the nightingale's love for the rose was born, sung by oriental poets. At the other end of the Bosphorus, on the Asian coast, near the Bulgurlu mountain, another valley is hidden, which is also famous for its nightingales and which the Turks called Bulbul-dere, the Valley of the Nightingale.&#160;
</p><p>The garden of our embassy is one of the best in Constantinople; after flower beds and terraces with clipped trees, with narrow alleys strewn with sea shells, with walls covered with ivy and jasmine, after this gallery of painstaking and miniature paintings, like engravings of an English almanac, it is pleasant to see a garden on the shores of the Bosphorus in a huge size, with trees and with shadows, combining the majestic beauty of nature with art, which so happily knows how to hide. Nowhere in the sea will horticulture find soil so artistically prepared by nature for the wonderful effects of the horizon. The last branches of the Thracian mountains, which make up the shores of the Buyukdere, now descend in sloping planes to the sea, now they appear as cliffs; between them are hidden valleys and gorges, overgrown with wild vegetation, and every height represents a finished belvedere, from where the gaze can alternately embrace the deserted sea, the strait or suburbs and the flowering coast of Asia.&#160;
</p><p>The ruins of the ancient temple of Venus are shown in the garden of the Austrian envoy, who wears the title of internuntia here. The goddess of love and beauty has lost her altars in Buyukdere, but she has her priestesses and her zealous adorers in this suburb. The place of the goddess of beauty herself in the buyukdere salons was taken at this time by the maiden F.S.

<p>A short stay in Pera forced travelers to postpone trips to Istanbul and Galata until another time; to reward themselves for their troubles, they decided to start from the farthest outskirts. The doctor and I were planning to go to Belgrade and then examine the Asian coast of the Bosphorus; our plans were in accord with the British plan; they volunteered to be our companions. The next day their schooner came to anchor in Terapi Bay, not far from our main apartment, Buyukdere. Our general factotum, Yarpog Apaso, was to bring good horses with Turkish grooms from Istanbul, and our new acquaintances undertook to prepare food for the entire trip, which, according to our calculations, was to last three days.

<p>He was on his way to the chiftlik, or Turkish manor, not far from Belgrade, and willingly agreed to be our companion. Thus, our caravan strengthened: fifteen people of Russians, Greeks, English and Turks were brought together by chance on the deserted paths of ancient Gemus. The diversity of costumes, the Asian and European dress of horses, the weapons that we have stocked up with, maybe for hunting, maybe for our own safety in this wilderness - all this, for me is already a thing&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="372">372&#160;</span></h2>
<p>old and familiar after my travels in mountainous Greece in the era of its internecine wars, had a charm of novelty for my companions, the British.
...
</p><p>After the pampered landscapes of the Bosphorus, the wild nature of the mountains had a special charm for us. The atmosphere was getting cooler; the wind dying in the Bosphorus valleys blows fresh and vital on the mountains; each time, leaving the valleys to the highlands, we opened the horizon more spacious and richer, and new pictures appeared and disappeared in this changing panorama. We left aside the Buyukdere Valley and the ancient aqueduct, one of the finest monuments and perhaps the most durable of Byzantine antiquities, producing such a wonderful effect in the depths of the valley when you look from the sea between the fresh perspective scenery of the Buyukder Mountains. Several such colossus step across the valleys from the Danish mountain streams to the ancient capital of the world. Before us were the dense forests of Belgrade; in the distance, a strip of the Black Sea could be seen, like a lace of foam, which ended the edges of a silk tent spread above us, bright blue and cloudless ... Thracian nature is here full of power and strict grandeur; the very solitude, the absence of any housing, any trace of a person, except for these gigantic monuments that carry your imagination to other centuries, further elevates the beauty of the landscape, abandoned among the luxurious&#160;
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="373">373&#160;</span></h2>
<p>the environs of Constantinople, like a faithful imprint of the harsh Thracian antiquity, like the last step of the wild Gemus, bent under the crown of its ancient forests to the moist bosom of the Bosphorus, but still retaining its primitive gloom and echoes of Orpheus's love songs among the frantic cries of the Thracian Bacchantes.&#160;
</p><p>Sycamore, oak and chestnut trees grow here in abundance, and I have never seen trees more beautiful and shady. My companions recalled the ancient oaks of their island, sung by Shakespeare: "giants of the forest with twisted arms, with hilly brows, monstrously hunched over, with wrinkled bark, with roots that forcefully dig into the ground in order to look out of it again." In Turkey, until now, the government pays so little attention to the conservation of its forests that the best of them in Thrace and along the Black Sea coast of Asia Minor will not exist for a long time with the incessant fires and restructuring of Istanbul. But the forests of Belgrade are inviolable; they seem to be guarded by a pagan reverence for the Druid forests - these temples planted by the gloomy nature of ancient Germany for the dark mysteries of northern mythology, or the poetic love of Hellas for her cherished groves, which the olive and laurel called heroes and poets. No sacraments are performed in the shade of the Belgrade forests; in our time, no wreaths are woven for anyone, but also the religious reverence of Muslims surrounds them, because that they save reservoirs in their shade, from which the thirst of the faithful Istanbul is quenched and his sins are washed several times a day.&#160;
</p><p>The ‘popular’ respect for these forests and the government’s concern for them goes back to the very ancient times of Constantinople. The founder of the Bosphorus capital himself took care of planting trees around the important valleys of Belgrade. The imperial edict exempted the inhabitants of that district from all duties so that they exclusively guard the forests and waters. Oaks and plane trees have outlived the world empire and its gigantic copper and marble monuments. The edicts of Constantine's successors subjected to strict foam anyone who would pluck a branch from Belgrade trees. Perhaps, the historian Nikitas says about them, that eunuchs were assigned to guard the trees, that they were protected as a pagan shrine, instead of building a fleet against enemies. The firmmen of the sultans revived the old law of the empire, not out of respect for the memory of Constantine, but to better conserve water, which loves the shade.
</p><p>After a three-hour journey, we entered Belgrade. This Slavic name in the neighborhood of Constantinople recalls the era when the Byzantine emperors, after the bloody wars with the northern tribes, had to call on semi-savage immigrants, populate their empire with them, accustom them to a settled life and convert them to Christians, peaceful shepherds and farmers. It is forbidden
</p><p>== 374 ==&#160;
</p><p>to determine the time of the founding of this Bulgarian colony, but it must be one of the oldest, because the Belgrade inhabitants have lost all the features of their Slavic origin and the very language preserved by their single-tribal Bulgarians along with the shepherd's life in the valleys of the Balkans.&#160;
</p><p>The decrepit city drowned in the greenery of its gardens. Between the poor huts, in places one can see large, wooden houses, like Bosphorus kiosks. All this is empty, neglected, and the gardens themselves have run wild since the time when Belgrade ceased to be the favorite summer residence of the best European society of Constantinople and ceded its rights to the suburbs of Buyukdere and Terapia. A hundred years before this, Belgrade was famous for its healthy air, and the envoys spent the summer months there. Societies, balls, concerts, all the amusements, all the etiquette of European capitals found a flourishing refuge in this Bulgarian town, and European life was bustling about in the secluded Thracian valley.&#160;
</p><p>The best memory of this brilliant Belgrade era is two letters from Lady Montagu, the wife of the English envoy. She writes to the Pope that she found the Champs Elysees of the ancients here. In the evenings, round dances of villagers and villagers gathered in front of her house, and a noble lady, an enthusiast of classical antiquity, saw nymphs in young Bulgarians, as poets and painters portray them. Belgrade settlers have retained the glory of their beauty to this day, but at the time when Lady Montague wrote, all the love intrigues of Europeans were concentrated in these romantic shadows. One thing was lacking only for the learned Englishwoman to imagine herself among the pagan Eden: she complains with coquettish pedantry and Latin quotations that between the Belgrade streams she did not find Lethe, whose waters would free her from the memories of the smoke of domestic fireplaces and gossip and the boredom of London society.
</p><p><br />
...
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="375">375</span></h2>
<p>We were taken to the house where Lady Montagu lived and which is known to the local residents as a Belgrade monument. Looking at the outdated house, we could not help but regret that today's Belgrade is not at all what it was a hundred years ago.&#160;
</p><p>The inhabitants have become impoverished since the Europeans stopped moving to them for the summer, protecting them from the oppression of the Turkish police and reviving their rural industry with their presence. The European missions left Belgrade due to fevers generated here from the evaporation of stagnant waters and from the dampness of the soil in the summer months; occasionally, the periodic winds of the Black Sea only break through among the wooded surroundings. However, hunting enthusiasts continue to visit this delightful place from time to time and spend autumn here. The forests abound with all kinds of game, and wild boars, hares, foxes, and many wolves and jackals lurk in the dense bushes of the surrounding mountains.
</p><p>We were too tired that day to think about hunting. Leaving the horses with one of the villagers, we went to inspect the bends, or reservoirs, located in the vicinity of Belgrade.
</p><p>This place, although it is thirty versts from Constantinople, was, however, chosen to supply the city with water, because the rivers Kydaris and Varvises, flowing through a low-lying place, could not be led into the city. The valley, deepened by an amphitheater between the hills, from which the water of the Balkans flows, was dug and received the appearance of an artificial pond; all the district springs were led into it, and in order to raise the water to a sufficient height, it was built up at its source with a colossal dam, worthy of the best monuments of Rome. At different times and as the population of the capital and the demand for water increased, other similar reservoirs were made and new dams were built. The Turks more than all the monuments of the empire respected and preserved bends and water pipes, as necessary for the capital of Islamism, which has no other means to supply itself with water. But the sultans, repairing dilapidated dams,
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="376">376</span></h2>
<p>as usual, they replaced the double-headed eagles, crosses and inscriptions of the ancient builders with their tour, or monograms, and new inscriptions, gilded and pompous with oriental boastfulness. The inscription covering the band that bears the name of the current sultan seems to be a whole poem in praise of Mahmud. They translated it for us, and I thought it was possible to write off its contents; she, no doubt, constitutes an excellent example of oriental eloquence, but in any European language there will be nonsense from this set of hyperbolic epithets and metaphors. What is not the name of Sultan Mahmud in it? He is the source of living water, and the center of the universe, and the soul of its body, and the benefactor of all tribes, and the ruler of power, and the refuge of all greatness, and the shadow of Allah, and the king of kings, and magnificent, and formidable, and vengeful, etc., and so on. “May Allah prolong the defensive shadow of his power over the peoples! He erected this band so that the peoples would praise Allah and bless his hand. The very waters of the mountain source have resigned themselves to his law and with obedience wear the marble chain of the bend, put on them by his powerful right hand. Just as these waters will not tear their dams, so his blessed reign will not be darkened by rebellions. Only the voice of a nightingale has been heard since the time the world submitted to its laws. As long as the sun at one o'clock in the morning will illuminate the emerald bowl of the Bend, and the stream of his will flows like a stream of these waters. "
</p><p>The poet's predictions did not quite come true, and the peace of the world caliphate is far from as strong as the submissiveness of the mountain streams, bound in dams.
</p><p>Colossal marble walls, carved and gilded, produce the most picturesque effect in this secluded spot amid dense greenery, wide shadows and a wide mirror of water along which they stretch motionlessly.
</p><p>Cold English food awaited us under the shade of a plane tree at the height of the dam. For the first time in their lives, our companions had to sit on a carpet in an Asian way, without chairs; but the splendor of our dining room, the freshness of the dense canopy of branches, the vista lined with a magnificent plumbing, and the songs of the nightingale with a cheerful accompaniment of water, which, rising to the height of the dam, flowed out of the holes made, fell down in a cascade and then formed a stream winding through the vastness of the valley - all it seemed to be enough to reward the English for the lack of chairs. We felt another drawback, a more significant one. Who would have guessed? At the very reservoirs and water pipes we could not get good water. It is cloudy and unpleasant to the taste here.
</p><p>We had to send for water to the source, which was about two versts from us. Even more unpleasant is the incredible multitude of frogs that inhabit these waters and sometimes even depressions, swimming on them after heavy rains. It is very strange that the Turks, who are so strictly ordered by religion to maintain cleanliness in their food, do not care about keeping their bodies of water tidy. However, this very water, dirty and fetid, having made its course to Istanbul, gushes in the city fountains, pure and transparent, like spring water.
</p><p>The Constantinople water system was the subject of scholarly research by Count Andreossi, French ambassador to the Ottoman Port. I stocked up on his book; it contains many interesting things about the hydraulic works of the Byzantines and Turks; but to understand it, you had to follow the direction of the water pipes
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="377">377</span></h2>
<p>from Belgrade to Istanbul and consider in detail all these complex works, which will become completely useless when Allah wills to reveal to the Turks the secret power of water to rise in pipes to such a height from which it descends. I postponed until another time the satisfaction of my curiosity on this subject and invited my companions to go to the Black Sea coast, which was not far from us.
</p><p>Having risen to the height of the last branches of the Balkans, we discovered the wet steppe of Pontus in all its glory. The Asian coast bent into an arc, protruding towards Europe at the fabulous Symplegades. Below us, a spacious valley stretched between the sea and the mountains, called, for some unknown reason, the Valley of Pigs, Domuz-dere. She deserved a better name. This coast is wild and deserted, like the sea washing it. He, obviously, was recently covered with forest, but now his nakedness is in striking contrast to the wooded mountains of Belgrade. There is a legend among the Turks that this place was designated for the landing of the Russian troops back in the wars of Catherine the Great in order to occupy the mountains of Belgrade from now on and cut off the water of Constantinople. In the last war, to prevent such an assassination attempt on the part of our troops, a camp was set up in this valley and trenches were made. The valley, dubbed only by the surf of the sea, presented during the summer of 1828 the animated spectacle of the Asiatic camp. Here was the headquarters of the 20,000-strong army, whose line stretched from the mouths of the Black Sea along the European coast to Burgas, but which did not prevent our fleet next year from taking Burgas, the only place for the landing of troops between the Balkans and Constantinople, and opening communications with the active army. Thus, the troops guarding Belgrade from the sea were completely useless. There were only irregular regiments recruited from the inner provinces of Asiatic Turkey; they were completely separated from the regular army, located in the Buyukdere valley and on the Daut Pasha hill, so as not to infect him with his violent spirit in that era when the sultan, during military alarms, introduced new discipline into his army. There were also fortified posts and batteries at all heights around Belgrade. The Turks are accustomed to the idea of ​​seeing our army under the walls of their capital and knowing that its Christian walls are too dilapidated to protect them, as they defended their emperors twenty-nine times during their millennium of existence.&#160;
</p><p>At nightfall, we set off on the return journey. We spent the night with a guest of a hospitable Belgrade villager, on straw and on mats, which we found after the fatigue of the day, softer than feather beds. At first we wanted to sleep under a clear sky, but we were advised to protect ourselves from the feverish dampness of the night and from the mosquitoes that fill the air.
</p><p>139 Several imperial edicts concerning waters, aqueducts and forests, intended solely for the preservation of waters, are collected in the scholarly work of Count Andreossi on Constantinople and the Bosphorus. It says that they are borrowed from Frontinus's book Peadiaedis Niz and Votae, but there is a misunderstanding: the Roman writer Sextus Julius Frontinus died at the beginning of the second century AD; unless commentators have added information about the water pipes of Constantinople to his creation.
