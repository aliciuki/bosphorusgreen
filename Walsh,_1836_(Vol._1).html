<p>It was the custom of Mustapha (The Sultan) constantly to engage in some amusement — sailing or fishing on the Bosphorus or hunting on its shores. He proceeded for this latter purpose to the forests of Belgrade; and the Bairactar determined to take advantage of his absence.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="279-283">279-283</span></h2>
<p>Buyukdere is a Turkish name, and implies the Great Valley. It is the largest of all those glens which divide the hills on the European side of the Bosphorus, penetrating five or six miles, and the view terminates in a magnificent aqueduct, which crosses it and conveys water from the bendts to the city. The space between is a flowery meadow, about a mile wide. Here it was that part of the Crusaders under Godfrey of Bouillon encamped in 1097, when they were proceeding to the siege of Nicaea. Here also the Turks form encampments at this day, and the Sultan is amused with those coarse and gross representations, in which the sensual Orientals delight. From the middle of this valley rises the great tree, which has been, in latter times, an object of much curiosity to travellers, and represented greater than the Castagna di Cento Cavalli, or that which in "Malabar or Deccan spreads her arms" This is a platanus of tremendous size; it measures forty-seven yards in circumference at its base, and the branches afford shade to a circular area of one hundred and thirty. I assure you there is no exaggeration in this, for I measured it myself. This vast stem, however, divides into fourteen branches, some of which issue from below the present surface of the soil, and some do not divide till they rise seven or eight feet above. One of the largest is broken off about twenty feet from the ground, another is hollowed out by fire, and affords a cabin to shelter herdsmen. This tree, if it can be considered a single plant, is certainly the largest in the world. Among other travellers who notice it, a French author describes it with some truth, as “Un temple de verdure surmouté d'un dôme pret à toucher les nues.” When the Turks encamp in the valley, the hollow of this great tree affords a magnificent tent to the Seraskier or Caimacan, who commands them, with all his officers. The platanus has been at all times in high repute in the East. Xerxes was so struck with the beauty of one in Phrygia, that he adorned it with collars and bracelets of gold. It was a convivial tree, under whose branches Socrates and Cicero were fond of sitting; and Pliny says one of his friends entertained a party of twenty-two persons at supper in the trunk of one. The Turks have the same partiality for it, and drink their coffee under its shade, which sometimes extends over a whole village. But what renders this tree an object of more than usual interest is the conjecture of M. de Candolle, that it must be more than two thousand years old. Though this tree has become such an object of admiration to recent travellers, Gillius takes no notice of it, nor even Tournefort, whose botanical pursuits would naturally lead him to do so.
</p><p>The village of Buyukdere extends from this valley for more than a mile along the shore towards the Black Sea. It is the residence of many European ambassadors and other respectable persons of Pera, who resort here in summer, when the sea-breezes of the Euxine so temper the air, that the thermometer is generally five or six degrees lower than in the city. The grounds are very picturesque; in front is a spacious quay, forming a noble marine parade on the edge of the Bosphorus&#160;; in the rear the hills rise behind the houses, laid out in hanging woods and terraces, which command magnificent views, so that perhaps there exists no where a more salubrious or beautiful residence.
</p><p>In the morning we resumed our caique, and proceeded on our voyage. Beyond Buyukdere, the Boghaz, as it is called, widens considerably; and as we approached the mouth, the great swell that came in was an object of alarm, our little bark was so light and fragile, and the undulations so immense. The entrance is formed by two bold promontories, on which are light-houses, they are therefore called the Phanaraki Points. The names on the Bosphorus are alternately Turkish or Greek; but this is a compound of both — Phanar Kui, Beacons-town; for there is a small village attached to each, and at some distance two for-tresses, whose white battlements form striking objects on the dark-green promontories. Between them, but much closer to the European shore, stood one of the Symplegades. The etymology of this name, which signifies "to strike together," recals the first important event of Grecian history. The mysterious terrors of this dark and stormy sea were so alarming, that the Greeks called it a^evos, impervious to strangers: but when Jason succeeded in the first bold commercial enterprise, and brought back his vessel safe from Colchis, the name was changed to Et/^cvof, to commemorate his hospitable reception. Of all the marvels which the lively imaginations of the people represent the Argonauts to have encountered, none was more extraordinary than those rocks, which stood like sentinels to guard the entrance of the forbidden sea, and crush between them the daring adventurers who attempted to pass them. The origin of this fable has been variously conjectured, and natural causes assigned to account for it, but the most probable appears to arise from the name of the sea, and the impression on the minds of the navigators — that as it had been closed before, so it might again close behind them after they had passed, and obstruct their return. I was disappointed, however, to see that there was but one conspicuous rock for this purpose; we found afterwards there was another within the Euxine, but at such a distance, and so close to the shore, that it could not be at all available for the purposes of the story. We pulled, however, for this one, and landed on it with some difficulty, the great swell rising nearly half way up the rock, and threatening to throw our light skiff on the ledge of some precipice.
</p><p>It stands about half a mile from the light-house point of the European shore, just within the Black Sea. It consists of a rocky eminence, twenty or thirty yards in height, and two or three hundred in circumference. On the summit is a very beautiful circular pedestal of pure marble and fine sculpture. It is four feet three inches in height, and two feet seven inches in diameter; round it is a rich festoon of flowers, supported on bulls’ heads, with stars between the folds. It is of superior workmanship, and seems to have been sculptured at an era when the arts were cultivated; but of its origin, date, or name, there is nothing certain; even its shape is not agreed on. The Byzantine historian, Dionysius, says the Romans erected a fane on this rock, and hence it is called the Altar. Whatever might have been its original destination, it was latterly appropriated to another use; this is the opinion of Gillius, who saw it in 1545. There stood upon it a Corinthian column, and the monument obtained the name of Pompey's Pillar, by which it is sometimes known. There was a vague tradition that he had erected it after his victory over Mithridates, whose kingdom of Pontus was close beside, on the coast of Asia. He named a city on the coast, built by that monarch, Pompeiopolis*; but there is no historical record of erecting a column: and Pompey has lost the reputation of this pillar, as well as of that at Alexandria, which it now appears was raised to Dioclesian. When Tournefort visited the rock in 1700, he saw the pillar, twelve feet in length, but it has now disappeared. On the summit of the pedestal which remains are four square apertures sunk into it, and they seem to have been intended to fasten on the top some other object.
