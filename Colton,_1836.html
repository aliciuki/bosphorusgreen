<p>The frequent ablutions which the Koran enjoins, render the Turks peculiarly solicitous on the subject of water. The copious use of this element is blended with the most vital principles of their religion. They regard the construction of a reservoir or fount as an act of meritorious piety; and the dying often seek in this form to cancel the crimes of a vicious life. These fountains are. among the first objects which excite the attention and admiration of the stranger in visiting the capital; they occupy the most conspicuous places, are generally constructed of fine marble, and are often richly gilt.
</p><p>As the soil of the city is extremely barren of springs, nearly the whole supply of water is brought through tiled aqueducts from bendts, or tanks, in the mountains, near the shores of the Black Sea. These high places are the regions of frequent showers and springs, whose copious tribute is confined and preserved in a number of glens, by casting a permanent mound across their deep channel. The water thus thrown back forms a pellucid lake; trees are thickly planted around it; the mound is covered with marble, and the whole becomes an object of magnificent beauty. It is death for a man to injure the mound, maim one of the trees, or take water from the bendts. On our excursion to Belgrade, we visited several of these woodland reservoirs: they afford a distant, but fresh and wholesome retreat from the dusty atmosphere of the city, and among any people of less indolent habits than the Turks they would become favorite resorts. But the silence of their green shade Is now seldom broken, except by the song of the early bird and the footsteps of the passing pilgrim. These bendts are not indebted for their design or construction to the ingenuity or industry of the Mussulmen. They originated in the provident wisdom of the Greek emperors when the increased population of the city rendered a greater supply of water necessary.

<p>Our excursion to the valley of Sweet Waters was followed by one of equal interest up the Bosphorus to the Black Sea, with diversions to Belgrade, and the Giant's Mountain. At an early hour we were in our caique, plying the stream with six steady oars and were soon sweeping past the spot where rest the remains of the brave Barbarossa. The first rays of the sun were gilding the mausoleum that rises in stately beauty over his dust, and each leaf and rose seemed bending towards his grave with the tribute of its tears. A short interval more, and we were opposite the Tower of Mahomet, where the standard of the Prophet secured its first strongly fortified position in Europe. The tower now be trays the crumbling effects of time, and has nothing strikingly fearful about it, save a low and gloomy entrance, most significantly called the "gate of oblivion," for none of the many noble criminals that have crossed its fatal threshold have ever revisited their homes&#160;! a cannon has been discharged to announce the moment of their death, and this has been the only comment accorded to their bitter end. The last sting that tyranny can give is realized by him who sinks beneath the instrument of the executioner in a solitary dungeon, without a friend to listen to his dying words, or witness his last moment.
</p><p>Doubling a bold bend of the shore, we now shot into a rapid pass of the stream, called the Devil's Current, and running with the celerity of a millrace. But why the quickness or turbulency of its footstep should place it under the jurisdiction of the evil one I could never learn It would seem as ifall the difficulties and deformities in the physical and moral world, too, are to be packed off on the poor devil, as if he had not troubles and crimes enough of his own. This is a very easy, but a very unjust mode of rid ding ourselves of blame and responsibility. Our virtues are our own, but all our sins the uncommiserated devil must answer for. Satan may well com plain, and write his remonstrance on the burning bars of his prison.
</p><p>Passing on, Buyukdere soon opened upon us, stretching along a broad and glittering strand, with a steep back ground of hanging gardens and impend. This is still the summer retreat of fo reign ambassadors; a place where they deign to lay aside a slight portion of that extreme etiquette so ridiculously absurd, annoying, and senseless. Could those who insist upon these nice formalities only create a respect for them, there would be some apology for their existence: but what can be more futile, when, with all the advantages of station, they cannot raise them above satirical contempt. The fop, who ribands his own coat, may be the admiration of children, but not of men.
</p><p>Leaving our boat, we called for horses, and were soon under a ten -knot speed for Belgrade; a rapid ity of motion not very replete with comfort to one unaccustomed to the clumsy construction of the Turkish saddle. I expected to leave some of my limbs, if not my head, on the road, for the plunge of the animal was like the strokes of a trip-hammer on the redoubling anvil. We soon entered an exten sive green valley, in the centre of which stands a plane tree of the most stupendous dimensions, formed by the solid and symmetrical union of seven, some twenty feet from the ground; while, nearer the root, the separate members were sufficiently apart to enclose a space that might accommodate a small tea-party. But this spot, it appears, has sterner associations than those connected with a twilight ter tulia. Here rested the chivalric Godfrey on his frantic expedition to Palestine; here reposed his battling legions, full of enthusiam, piety, and plunder. Their enterprise was like themselves, a kindling compound of reckless adventure and religious, frenzy. In their zeal to rescue the holy sepulchre, they forgot the first precepts of Him who there set the seal of his divinity to the meek and patient spirit of his religion. They forgot the declaration, in which their own fate was strikingly prefigured, "they who take the sword must perish by the sword."
</p><p>The valley gradually narrowed to a ravine; and proceeding on, we passed under the lofty arch of an aqueduct, connected with the mountain lakes which supply the great capital with water. Here striking into a thick wood, our surrogee suddenly halted for us, whispering that he heard the snap of a rifle, muttering something about brigands, and drawing one of his heavy pistols, instantly darted into the thicket, from which the ominous sound had proceeded. But it was only a Greek sportsman and a pigeon; both of whom we frightened and sundered so far, I doubt if they ever meet again. Recovering our path, and descending a steep hillat a rapid step, the horse of our protector tripped, and threw him over his head a good duelling distance. His turban rolled one way, his pistols another, with his yategan and pipe between. We hastened to proffer assistance, but the Janizary gathered himself up with out aid, replaced his turban and weapons of death, and without uttering a word to man or beast, remounted with the composure and solemnity of one who had deliberately alighted to do homage to the genius of some consecrated spot. How many, reared under a more moral and refined system of education, would have lost their patience and sobriety in a paroxysm of rage? The most wise and polished may gather some lessons of practical wisdom from the deportment of a savage.
</p><p>We now broke within the environs of Belgrade; a small, ruinous, and half-deserted village; totally unworthy, in itself of the pains we had taken; but which has circumstantial attractions of a high order. It is embosomed in a vast forest, and through the green glades commands a view of the bendts, or small lakes, which fillthe mountain glens, and so terminate the vista as to leave an impression of still continued beauty and brilliancy. This quiet spot, in which you feel yourself far removed from the strife and clamor of the world, was the favorite retreat of Lady Montague; over it her genius has cast a spell that will survive the last relic of its ruins. The dwelling which she inhabited has crumbled; the flowers and fruit-trees which she planted have perished; but the brook, by whose melodious margin she strayed, stil murmurs its music, and still attracts the listening bird to where it tells its bubbling tales. The monuments of human skill may cease as memorials of our being but the tablets of nature are imperishable.
</p><p>A circle of Greek girls, frolicking under the clus tering shade of some dark chesnut trees, now drew our attention.We approached them carelessly, as if bound to some object beyond, and commenced our sociabilities by inquiries, such as the most honest and ignorant would put to the most child-like and timid. Thus we gradually drew them into conversation and insinuated ourselves into their confidence and good graces, till we ventured to produce our collation and invite them to join us. The younger cast their flashing eyes upon the older for assent; which being given, we were soon seated on the green grass and were happy to find in our wallet a number of little nicknacks well suited to the occasion. I have never been at a banquet that I so much enjoyed, as this most simple, rural refreshment: not merely that exercise and excitement had imparted a keener relish, but the place where we were, its gentle recollections, its seclusion and quietude, the stream that rippled past us over its pebbly bed, the whispering leaf above, and then, the bright beings before us, so untouched by sorrow, so full of joyous life all made that hour one that will never cease to preserve it brightness among the darker memories of my heart. But for these green spots in the desert of life we should almost become weary of our pilgrimage, and sigh for that rest where the summons to unwelcome toil never comes.
</p><p>We returned to Buyukdere, found our caique with its strong oarsmen; and gliding up between the banks of the Bosphorus, which here present a continuous line of bristling batteries, passed into the Black Sea . This vast expanse of water derives its forbidding name from the dark storms which frequently gather over its bosom. We did not tempt the distant wave; but like Jason, our great nautical exemplar, kept near the shore— he in search of the golden fleece - We of the sympligades; and if a huge mass of black rock, crowned with an altar piece, and washed by the dark waves of the Euxine, could be worthy of even our adventure, then we were not without our reward. Making a short circuit, we reentered the ocean stream, and descending as far as the foot of Giant's Mountain, debarked and labored up that difficultand widely commanding elevation. On its summit stands a chapel of the Whirling Dervishes; a sect who would fain make us believe that the true way of getting into heaven is to whirl round like a top, and that the quicker the motion the more rapid the advancement, and the greater the attainments of the individual in sanctity and devotion. In harmony with the reasonableness of this whirling faith is the accredited statue of the Giant, whose stupendous attitude furnishes a befitting name for the mountain; and who is now regarded by the giddy brotherhood in the light of a patron saint. He could sit, said the principal, on the top of this high mount, and lave his feet in the Bosphorus, or step across that broad current into Europe at a single stride; and then, as if to remove the possibility of doubt from our minds, pointed us to his grave near the chapel, and which, though it embraced little more than his head, was fifty feet in length.
