<p>"Yeni Kieui that follows is the first of the "fashionable villages" and appears to have always been called "the new village" at least ever since it has existed, which may have been some seven years before Gillius wrote about it in 1550; that is after the establishment of the Turkish dominion in Europe.
</p><p>Just above this village, however, and opposite Kalender, the fashionable afternoon resort of Europeans in the summer, are the rocks which
</p><p>the ancients called Bacchias&#160;; and had those who lived in Philip's time the same affection for this spot that is evinced by their descendants in the present day, they must have witnessed from the shore the naval battle won by the Byzantine sailors against Demetrius, Philip’s general, which earned for it the name of Thermimetria, in commemoration of the skill and ardour displayed in the engagement.
</p><p>Kalender itself was formerly called Limin Pithicon, or “Harbour of Pithicus”; but was afterwards changed into Libadion, or “Grassy Plot”, which is a far more appropriate appellation.
</p><p>We now come to Therapia, the most celebrated of all the villages on the Bosphorus.
</p><p>It was known as Pharmakea, “poison,” for many centuries before Atticus, a Greek patriarch, but he, finding the name unsavoury to his ears, changed it into that which it has preserved. Part of it was called Linos, and the other Endios Kalos, “Pretty Bay.”
</p><p>Here it was that Medea deposited her drugs, and here it was that, before the glorious epoch when the spirit of independence beat high in the bosoms of the oppressed Greeks, their noblest scions came, and endeavoured to cement with their wealthy compatriots of the Phanar that union so essential to their cause, for which they afterwards most bravely fought, but which their unhappy character never allowed them successfully to maintain.
</p><p>Midway between Therapia and the valley of Bouyukdere there is a pretty terrace overlooking some stones, against which the sea, coming in a straight line from the entrance to the Bosphorus, beats with some force. The place is called Kiretch Boumou, probably on account of some lime-kilns which formerly existed there; but the stones have a tradition.
</p><p>One of them was formerly called Dikeea, or “the Just Stone.” Two merchants agreed, before a journey which they undertook in the Euxine Sea, to place what gold they had beneath this cone-shaped piece of rock, and swore that, should the one return before the other, he would wait his companion’s ,return before taking possession of the money they had secreted.
</p><p>One of them, however, would have broken the engagement he had entered upon with his friend, had he not had to deal with a stone that guessed his culpable designs. On looking for the gold he could find it nowhere; but when his friend had returned, and he had informed him of the loss of the money, behold! the gold was there, in proof of the fidelity of the rock in restoring its trust. It was ever after known as ‘the Just Stone.’
</p><p>Just before entering the Bouyukdere valley there is a cluster of houses, and a very small mosque, which has rather a pretty appearance, and the whole goes by the name of Kefeli Kieui.
</p><p>No notice of the place is what its importance might justify; but the cape where stands the mosque was formerly called Saron; and hard by, in the village itself, stood a monster statue of Saron, whom the Megarians honoured as God of the Sea.
</p><p>We now come to one of those beautiful meadows which are so numerous on both the shores of the Bosphorus.
Its common name is “the Valley of Bouyukdere” its technical appellation is Kirk Aghadji (‘ Forty Trees’)&#160;; or more correctly, Yedi Kardachlar (‘ Seven Brothers’)&#160;; and its ancient denomination, Calos Agros, or ‘the Beautiful Fields.’
To say that there are forty trees in this plain is to speak of that which is not; but to talk of the fine plane-trees which shade the Armenian women in summer, when the open-air coffee and cigarette are cheap luxuries at the Seven Brothers, is to give to their graceful clustering a semblance of truth.
There is a popular belief that a portion of the army of the Crusaders was encamped in this meadow, under the command of- Godfrey of Bouillon, in 1096&#160;; and M. Michaud, a French Academician, who appears to have studied the question, confirms this opinion, by spreading the army of the Crusaders all over the land that extends from Maltepe, near Chalcedon, on the Asiatic side, to Belgrade, five miles away from Bouyukdere on the European coast, and establishing Godfrey de Bouillon’s general quarters in that same meadow of Calos Agros.
</p><p>Bouyukdere itself is not very ancient, though we hear of Count Raoul of Flanders having encamped with his Crusaders at a place called&#160; , which is the modern Bouyukdere.
</p><p>It is now the richest of the villages on the Bosphorus. Its quay is the widest, and its houses are the handsomest, on either shore; but prettily situated as it is, it bears no comparison, I think, with its less prosperous companions.
At the end of Bouyukdere quay there is a promontory now called Mezar Bournou, and formerly styled Simas, whereon stood the statue of Venus Meretrix.
</p><p>Hammer derives the name Simas from Simos, which he maintains signifies in modern Greek “a nose”; but M. Timoni angrily denies the statement, and believes that the cape was called Simas in honour of a very beautiful courtesan who had established herself opposite to the landing-place.
</p><p>Next comes the valley of Seletrina, which is the modern Yeni Mahalle (‘New Quarter’)&#160;; and if from it one diverges to the left, he may come to the pretty valley of&#160; — a lovely spot, where some fine chestnuts and a clear fountain afford all the delights of shade and rest on a hot summer’s day.
</p><p>Following the coast, Teli Tabia is soon reached, and close to these batteries are the walls of the fort that crowns the heights of the village of Rouméiie Kawack.
</p><p>The temples of Rhea, of Serapis, and of the Sibyl, were all within this district up to Mavromolos, but it is impossible to discover their exact position.
</p><p>The Genoese, who built two castles, one on the Asiatic side, facing the one on the European side, in order that they might exact a toll from aU ships coming into the Bosphorus from the Black Sea, may have used the foundations and ruins of these temples in the construction of their castles. It is certain that a careful investigation of these places, and a discreet excavation, would bring many treasures to light that are now altogether lost or ignored.
</p><p>On coming down from the heights into the plain, the little river is seen that flows gently upon a golden bed into the deep Bosphorus, and which anciently was called Chrysorhoas. The Temple of Rhea was near it, and in Christian times there was a pretty chapel of Our Lady, called Our Lady of the Chestnut Trees.
</p><p>Bouyuk Liman, or ‘”the Big Port,” which comes next, was the ancient Aphosiatin, the hairbour of the Ephesians&#160;; and on the heights above it was the town of Gypopolis, where reigned the unfortunate King Phineus, whom the Argonauts consulted and delivered from the Harpies.
</p><p>Close to the harbour of the Ephesians came the Aphrodision and the harbour of the Lyceans, commanded by a statue of Aphrodite, their favourite goddess&#160;; then the lighthouse, Fanaraki, built on a stone -which projects from the land, is hid by the waves, and was called 1 the Promontory of Pan.”
</p><p>The Cyanean rocks, at the entrance of the Bosphorus, close the list of places on the European side. They are opposite Fanaraki, and were called Symplegades, because seen from one side they appear to be joined together.
</p><p>These rocks were very celebrated in antiquity, and sailors used to offer sacrifices before leaving port to commit their persons and property to the ocean. The Romans erected a temple upon them in honour of Apollo, and also a column of white marble, which was called Pompey’s Column, though there is no record of Pompey erecting any trophy in these parts after his defeat of Mithridates. The inscription, besides, is said to have been carved in praise of Augustus, though, by some singular effect of civilisation, nothing remains now on the basis upon which the column must have been placed except the word “Paris, “ carved in the rock.
