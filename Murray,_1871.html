<p>The remnants of the Bosdohan Kemeri or Kemer Altu, the aqueduct of Valens, pass over many of the streets and intersect some of the most densely habited portions of the Suleimanyeh and At-Bazary (horse-market) quarters; it connects what are called the third and fourth hills. Its double row of 40 Gothic arches seems to have been rebuilt by Suleiman out of the old materials of intermixed stone and tile, and probably in the ancient form. It presents a picturesque and noble object from many of the points of view round Stambool, especially when seen towards sunset, when the western rays pouring through the remaining arches, overhung with foliage, tinge all the surrounding objects with that inimitable purple and golden haze peculiar to the Bosphorus; it is still used to convey water by pipes laid along its summit.’ This aqueduct is supplied from the bends or reservoirs about Belgrade. The ancient cisterns above described were once supplied from the same source.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="129-130">129-130</span></h2>
<p>Buyukdereh - The summer residence of the greater portion of the European embassies is so called from the great valley which stretches 3 mn inland, as a continuation of the bay, as far as the wooded heights which crown the aqueduct of Bagcheh Keui. The beautiful bay was formerly called Vathy Kolpos, or the deep bay. The “Great Valley” is not less resorted to as a promenade than the cemetery at Pera. In the lower part of this beautiful meadow is the most splendid group of trees on the Bosphorus, consisting of 7 plane-trees, which together form the Seven Brothers (Yedi-Kardash). The tradition, that Godfrey of Bouillon was here encamped with his army of crusaders in 1096, is not alluded to by any of the historians of the Crusades; nor is it very probable that the crusaders who crossed over to Chalcedon from Kosmidion, or the palace at the end of the harbor of Constantinople, should have come this way. The village of Buyukdereh consists of a lover and upper village. There’s an hotel, belonging to M. Rapierre. In the upper village are the houses of the poorer Greeks, Armenians, and a few Turks, and in the lower the summer residences and gardens of the European ambassadors, and rich natives. Amongst these, the most distinguished by the regularity of its architecture and its lovely situation, is the Russian Palace…
</p><p>The walk rides about Buyukdereh are numerous and beautiful, and it is the best base of operations for the traveler who is desirous of visiting the forest of Belgrade; its reservoirs and aqueducts, the wilds of the Upper Bosphorus, the Giant’s Mountain, the Genoese Castle, and the lovely valleys of Hunkar Iskelesi and Beikos. No one, therefore visiting the capital between May and November, who can afford the time, should omit to spend a week or more here. Thıse who cannot stay so long may still find means of visiting any of these places by spending a night at the Hotel at Buyukdereh, and making an excursion on the next day before returning by the steamer to Contantinople in the afternoon. The Valley of the Roses, Kesteneh Sooyoo (the fountain of the chestnut trees), or Kirej Boornoo (Limestone Point), would make a delightful object for a walk, if an hour or two should remain unemployed. At the latter shady place the Englishman on his travels, who has, after his country’s fashion, cut and carved himself into immortality on every bench in Europe may here find himself outwhittled by a travelling shawl-merchant, of Ispahan, who has carved a piece of doggerel poetry, in the beautiful Persian caharacter, round the bark of the largest of the trees. The lines convey the sentiment of the writer’s perishable mortality, while the letters written would remain. From Kesteneh Sooyoo one can return to Buyukdereh through the garden of the Russian Embassy, when leave is obtained at the gate and a beautiful view will be enjoyed in the descent from the hill. The Valley of the Roses is seen on the way to Kesteneh Sooyoo. The ride along the shore towards the N. İs very fine, and if extended to Domoozdereh, the swine valley, a village on the Black Sea, Belgrade, might be seen partially on the way back; that is, the forest is crossed, and it is the principal charm of that village. This ride is not less than 25 m. There is a carriage road, barely practicable, between Therapia and Buyukdere, and from both places to Pera.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="130-131">130-131</span></h2>
<p>Bagcheh Keui - We now turn, for a moment, from the seashore into the interior, to notice two villages which are frequently visited by the Europeans residing at Buyukdereh, who sometimes make them their country residence. These two villages are Bagcheh Keui and Belgrade. The former is situated on the summit of the range of hills to which the long and narrowing valley of Buyukdereh ascends, at about 3 m. distance from the sea. The foreground is formed of picturesque plantains and cypresses, and the new aqueduct of Sultan Mahmood I. closes in the valley. One of the best points for enjoying the beautiful prospect is immediately under the great arch, through which the road from Buyukdereh ascends to Bagcheh Keui.
</p><p>The Aqueduct, built by Sultan Mahmood in 1732, supplies the suburbs of Pera, Galata, and Beshiktash with water, and is a grand hydraulic work, worthy to rival those of the Byzantine emperors; nay, it may be said that Sultan Mahmood I. deserves higher praise than Suleiman the Great, since the latter only restored or enlarged the aqueducts of the Byzantine emperors, whilst the former commenced a grand work of his own, in order to supply the harbour opposite the town. The work consists, 1st, of two Bends, or dammed-up valleys, in which the water is collected as in a great reservoir (one of these bends bears the name of Sultan Mahmood, the other that of his mother, the Valideh); 2ndly, of the walled aqueduct of 21 arches, 40 yds. broad, and 560 yds. long, of the 2 taksim, or towers with water-pipes connecting at a trough upon the top, dividing the water just before the entrance of Pera and the burying-grounds, one built by Mahmood I., the other by Selim III.; finally, of a double range of water columns erected on the road, from a false notion that they increase the force of the water. Of these, 4 stand behind each other in the valley of Levend chiftlik, half-way between Pera and Buyukdereh, and 2 others near the latter place, at the mouth of a narrow defile.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="131-132">131-132</span></h2>
<p>Belgrade - 3 m. further in the interior ties the village of Belgrade, in the middle of a forest of 15 or 18 m. in circumference. On the preservation of these woods depends the supply of the great reservoir; and the corporation of the water-suppliers is charged with the double care of cleaning the bends and preserving the woods. The forest of Belgrade, the only one in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, on the Thracian side of the Bosphorus, is therefore, in the fullest sense, a sacred grove, whose trees are never touched by the axe, and whose springs are not allowed to dry up. In the time of the Byzantines the place was called Petra; and the reservoir built here by Andronicus Comnenus in the hollow between 2 hills is one of the bends, between which lies the village of Belgrade. Besides these 2 great reservoirs, of which one is distinguished as the “Great Bend”, there are on both sides of it 2 small bends; of which the one on the rt. is called Pashah Dereh. The water of these 4 great bends flows in a combined stream to the Bash-havooz, or great cistern of Pyrgos, first built by Andronicus Comnenus, which is at present called after Sultan Osman II. To the westward of Belgrade, and to the N. of the bend of the valley of Pasha Dereh, is the Bend of Aivat, in the valley of Evhadeddin. This is the newest of all, having been built in 1766, under the reign of Moostafa III., in order to furnish a plentiful supply to the cistern. The water of this bend flows westward from Pyrgos to the cistern, and runs in 2 aqueducts, one of which is called the long aqueduct, over 2 valleys, and then again under ground. The waters of the Bend of Belgrade and Aivat, which meet at the Bash-havooz, continue thence in one stream towards the city, crossing again over 2 valleys, one by means of the great aqueduct, called the aqueduct of Justinian , the second by a smaller one. The whole arrangement, therefore, of the aqueducts of Bagcheh Keui and Belgrade consists of 7 bends and as many aqueducts visible above ground. The 7 bends are the 2 great ones of Belgrade&#160;; then the 2 small ones, of which one is called Pashadereh; the Bend of Aivat, and the 2 bends of Bagcheh Keui. The 7 aqueducts are, the 2 curved ones on the road from Belgrade to Pyrgos; the 2 great ones on the road from the Bend of Aivat to the cistern of Pyrgos; the 2 aqueducts which carry the water thence to the city, one of which is the aqueduct of Justinian; and, lastly, that of Bagcheh Keui.
</p><p>Besides the importance which the village of Belgrade derives from its aqueducts and reservoirs, it is remarkable for possessing the loveliest walks on the whole of the Thracian side of the Bosphorus; the thick woods are the resort of a great variety of game, among which pheasants, deer, and the large stag itself are the chief. The beauty of Belgrade is perhaps over-praised: the woods are not of large growth; the reservoirs are filled with turbid water, brought from the neighbouring brooks, and are the resort of myriads of frogs, whose croaking, in the spring, drowns every other sound. Yet these woods, in the fair days of spring, form a favourite resort for Franks, Greeks, and Armenians. The latter, not contented with passing here their Sundays and holidays, spend weeks together in the spring in the uninterrupted enjoyment of the happiest indolence, giving to the spot the name of Defi-gham, i.e. care-dispeller; and, indeed, a more delightful sans-souci cannot be imagined than the wood-crowned lawns of Belgrade. The beautiful village fountain has long since been celebrated in the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who made this her summer residence; and the house which she occupied is still shown by the villagers. Formerly several of the European envoys lived at Belgrade, as well as at Therapia and Buyukdereh, during the fine season; but as fevers prevail at the end of the summer, in consequence of the damp from the water, Buyukdereh and Therapia have been preferred, for their ever pure and wholesome temperature. Of late, European families have spent only the beginning of summer at Belgrade, and the end of it at Buyukdereh. He who wishes to pass 6 months of the finest season in the most beautiful environs of Constantinople will pass the spring in the beginning of May at the Princes’ Islands, spend the following month at Belgrade, breathe during the summer months the cool sea-air on the banks of the Bosphorus, repair again in the autumn to the milder climate of the Princes’ Islands, and pass the winter in the city.
</p><p>Belgrade by road is a ride of about 15 m. from Constantinople - at the end of 6 m. under the shade of trees.
</p>

<p>Sarùyeri – Wemust now return again from the interior to the seashore, and continue our walk to the mouth of the Bosphorus. The point of land with which the great bay of Buyukdereh terminates to the N. is called Mezar Boornoo, or the Cape of Tombs, from the grove of tombs of Saruyeri situated on the other side of it. Sarůyeri means the yellow spot; an appropriate appellation, on account of the colour of the rocks. The village is principally inhabited by fishermen, skippers, and gardeners. The fruit-gardens are particularly famous for their cherries. Murad IV., on visiting here the garden of a certain Solak, exclaimed, “I, the servant of the two noblest harems (of Mecca and Medina), possess no such garden as this!” In ancient times the point of Mezar Boornoo was called Simas, and the bay of Sarùyeri, Scletrinas. On the promontory of Simas stood a statue of Venus Meretricia, to which the sailors were particularly supposed to offer sacrifices. At the end of the valley of Sarùyeri a walk leads to the spring of Kestanehsoo, or the Chestnut Water, which is considered as inferior only to that of Chamlijah.
</p><p>Roomeli Kavak – The promontory immediately beyond Sarüyeri was in ancient times called Amilton. At the foot of it is the new battery of Deli Tabia, which, together with the opposite battery of Madjw, was built in 1794 by the French engineer Monnier. On the other side of the promontory of Amilton is the castle of Roomeli Kavak, which, as well as the opposite fortress of Anadoloo Kavak; was built by Sultan Moorad IV., to protect the Bosphorus from the incursions of the Cossacks. Jason, after having offered sacrifices on the Asiatic side to the 12 great gods, erected on the European shore an altar to Cybele, as he had already done on the mountain of Dindymos or Cysicus , and at the mouth of the Phasis. In the time of the Byzantines the 2 castles which defended the straits of the Bosphorus were situated on the summits of the 2 opposite mountains, and bound to them by walls which ran straight down the mountain to the shore. The strait itself was, in time of need, closed by a great chain, which stretched from one shore to the other, and thus the line of defence went from mountain to mountain, stretched like a rope, inasmuch as the two castles were connected by the walls with the dams, and with each other by means of the chain across. These castles of which the Asiatic one is tolerably preserved, but the European one only visible in the ruins of the walls, are at present known under the name of the Genoese castles. In reality, the Asiatic castle did belong in the last days of the Byzantine empire to the Genoese, who levied the toll of the Bosphorus. The next narrow valley after the mound of Mauros Molos leads to a spring, over which, in the time of Gyllius, there stood the chapel of the Holy Maria of the Chestnut Spring. On the top of the chapel of the Holy Maria of the Chestnut Spring. On the top of the height to which this defile leads, stands a large ancient round tower, which Dionysius called Turris Timaea, and which formerly served as a watch-tower. This was the old Pharos, from which torches were held up at night, whose light, placed in a straight line with those at the mouth of the Bosphorus, saved the ships navigating the Black Sea from being wrecked on the Cyanean rocks or the Thracian coast. The ancient inhabitants, a barbarous and cruel people, used often to light fires in the most dangerous places in order to embarrass the mariners, who took them for the lighthouse, and who, after suffering shipwreck, were robbed of their cargoes. This crime was more particularly indulged in by the inhabitants of the coast of Salmydessus, now called Midia, and the same is done at the present day by the people of the same coasts, to the great detriment of navigation.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="133-134">133-134</span></h2>
<p>Buyuk Liman . — Beyond the defile of Mauros Molos there is no further path along the shore, which rises in precipitous rocks from the sea; but the road ascends the summit, and continues at the top of the cliff. Where the rocks terminate in a promontoiy, the curve of the land forms a harbour, called the great harbour of Buyuk Liman, formerly the harbour of the Ephesians. This is the first port on this side for the ships running in from the Black Sea, which throws up a long heavy swell.
</p><p>Karibjeh. — This promontory, which closes the harbour of Buyuk Liman, is called Tashlanjik, i. e. the Stony, on account of the singularly wild, barren, and inhospitable shore, as far as the point enclosed within the fortress of Karibjeh , erected for the defence of the mouth of the Bosphorus. This mass of rock was formerly called Gypopolis, i. e. the Vulture town. Here was the fabled court of King Phineas, where he entertained the Argonauts, who defended him from his troublesome guests the Harpies.
</p><p>Fener Keui , or Fanaraki , i.e. the village of the Lighthouse, lies at the extreme point of the European side of the Bosphorus. Opposite to it are the Cyanean rocks, or Symplegades, through which Jason steered the Argonauts with no less good fortune than danger. They were called the Cyanean, i. e. the bluish rocks, from their colour, and the Symplegades, i. e. the rocks striking together. The story of their mobility probably arose from their appearing or disappearing when the sea was high and stormy, being hardly 6 feet above the level of the water. Jason, who sailed to capture the golden fleece, or (to rescue historical truth from the garb of poetic fable) to obtain the precious sheep’s wool of Colchis, dared, and happily performed, the dangerous passage, after having followed the advice of the good king Phineas, not to make the attempt until he had previously sent out a dove. The Dove was probably the name of a small craft, of a similar description to that which the Turks make use of at the present day, bearing the name of another bird, Kurlanguj, i. e. the Swallow, and was sent forward to examine the dangerous passage. When the poet relates that the vessel, by the separation of the Symplegades, happily passed through, but lost a portion of its tail, which the islands striking together, caught hold of and jammed, the meaning is no other, than that the ship, hastening onward, was injured by a rock in the stem, and lost its rudder. The island is considered by some as showing, when seen on coming from the Black Sea, the appearance of the hull of a vessel between two rocks. The dove, as the herald of the deluges of Noah and Deucalion, was quite as appropriate a name for a small boat of passage as that of the swallow, which is esteemed both in the East and in the West as an omen of fortune and safety. The Symplegades are the termination of our rambles on the western bank of the Bosphorus. The pedestal of a column, which rises on this fine pointed mass of rock, and appears to have been an altar erected by the Bomans to Apollo, was formerly as falsely termed the Pillar of Pompey by travellers as that of Alexandria. In the same manner travellers have called the maiden tower opposite Skutari the tower of Leander, and that on the heights above Maurus Molos the tower of Ovid, although Leander and Ovid have most innocently been invested with such paternal honours. Probably here stood the enormous goblet which Pausanias dedicated at the mouth of the Bosphorus, and of which Herodotus saw a portion on the banks of the Hyginus, 6 in. thick, of bronze, and holding 600 amphorae.
</p><p>Kilia. — Previous to quitting the European side of the Bosphorus, it may be well to point out the villages of Yerli Keui, the aboriginal village, Demirji Keui , the blacksmith’s village, and Domoozdereh , the boar valley, at the termination of which, towards the sea, are to be seen some thick layers of lignite, forming a part of a deposit which, further on, is worked out in a mine, furnishing coal of an inferior quality. The fortress of Kilia, in a bay of the Euxine, is the outwork which guards the European side of the Bosphorus, as that of Riva guards the opposite shore of Asia. The bay itself is a famous fishing station. The next place after Kilia on the shore of the Black Sea is Derkos, the ancient Derkon, or Denelton, a day’s journey from Constantinople. Between Derkon and Selymbria (Silivri) was the great Anastasian Wall, intended to protect the capital against the attacks of the barbarians.
