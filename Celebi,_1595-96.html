<p>Selim Khan—may God's mercy and pardon be upon him—while passing through the suburbs in the environs of Istanbul one morning, lighting up the world with his perfect beauty like the world-illumining sun, proceeded across the plain of Kağıdhane, where his felicitous route took him to a luxuriant meadow and a heart-attracting green field. Flowing streams were hidden among the straw and thorns like a mirage, their channels ravaged and in ruin, and a spring-like fountain of life was concealed from the eyes of the world in the darkness of the black earth.
</p><p><br />
Couplet
</p><p>It seems that water, like a fugitive, broke through its dam.
[5b] It hid itself among the thorns and weeds.
</p><p><br />
The dewdrop-like gaze of the felicitous padishah, refuge of the universe, fell upon this pure water. At first glance it appeared to his world-seeing eyes that it would be simple to bring it to the city of Istanbul. With auspicious resolve to bring this fugitive to heel<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and sate the thirsty of the world, he spurred the Rakhsh of his zeal<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> to the valley of commencement<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>. Arriving at the imperial palace, he gathered together the high officials of state and ordered an investigation and inquiry into the ways in which the pleasant, flowing water, which was in former times the cause of the city's growth and increase, had reached it<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>. According to the accounts of historians, it appeared from the legends of men of old that when Yanko son of Madyan<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>, the builder of the city of Constantinople, founded this city, he enclosed its seven hills within walls and gave it the name Peninsula of the Seven Hills (Cezīre-i Heft Cebel). At that time, he built cisterns to collect the rainwater from its high buildings. The present-day sunken gardens<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> are remains of them, and the Binbirdirek<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> beneath the At Meydanı<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> is one of these. [The people of Constantinople] are said to have subsisted on rainwater that was collected in them. Subsequently, a ruler built the Kırkçeşme Aqueducts<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> and brought water from that direction. In time [however], they were cut off from their source by silt and [the water] disappeared.
</p><p>When [the grandees had] submitted [this information] to the late and forgiven padishah, refuge of the universe, he said, "Every art has its master and every [Mount] Bisutun has its Ferhad<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>. This work requires consultation with the [chief] architect<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>. What this demands is an approach that is practical, not theoretical.
</p><p>Saying this, the most noble command of that Solomon of men and jinns reached this weak ant: "Let the diligent architect give careful consideration and attention to the bringing of this water to the city of Istanbul, since the completion of this unparalleled act of charity is my noble, world-seizing wish." And he charged this humble servant with the construction of the water channels.
</p><p><br />
Couplet
</p><p>I joined together the aqueducts in many places like a pipe
</p><p>So as to be a guide for this delight-giving water.
</p><p><br />
Putting his trust in God, this humble servant measured the heights and depths of the valleys with an aerial balance<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>. [6a] And while searching from place to place for those ancient aqueducts and pondering this great task, I prayed to God and said, "O, Omnipotent Creator! O, All-Powerful and All Compelling One! Of what value is this useless, foolish ant that his words in the service of the Solomon of the age should be held in esteem?"
</p><p><br />
Hemistich
</p><p>But for the favor of You Who are our protector!
</p><p><br />
In sum, the course of those streams that escaped into those ravines was in ruin and disrepair, and the hidden [and] escaping water flowed through the grassy meadows toward the open country. I sequestered [the water] at its source, dug a ditch in the direction of the mountains, and in that manner brought water that had been spilling out into the open country via a stream. And I constructed a dam and, in accord with the science of engineering (hendese, i.e., geometry), attached waterspouts (lüle)<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> to the timbers. And after determining the number of water spouts, by means of analogy and the science of geometry, I immediately wrote down an estimate of [the volume of discharge] of the other streams, based on the foliage and plant growth [along their banks]. And I informed His Majesty the padishah, refuge of the universe, as follows: "My felicitous padishah, signs of that fountain of life in this dark earth and tidings of the water of life in this verdure of the Hızır of the age are to the sagacious mind clear as day. And the water of these valleys is detectable and the channels already largely exist. Their immediate completion depends on the zeal of the king of kings."

<p>Quatrain
</p><p>O Solomon of the age on the throne of felicity, this is
</p><p>The petition of this weak ant to the dust of your feet:
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May you show zeal that water again flows to the place where once it flowed!
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It used to flow to the gardens and meadows of Istanbul.
</p><p><br />
Prose
</p><p>That Solomon of men and jinns consulted this weak ant and felicitously said, "How might this water be brought?" And I replied, "My padishah, there are two ways to do this. One is as follows: [In number,] your subjects are without limit or measure. At your command, each of them would give his life in your service. And another is that recompense should be given to everyone in the form of wages. Spending a treasury, it would be constructed with wages." The late and forgiven [sultan] ordered, "Your first plan is of no advantage to us, for it would be the charity of others. The latter is the useful plan. Let us bring [the water] using payment from our own wealth. [6b] Let no one's feelings be hurt in the slightest degree."
</p><p><br />
Verse
</p><p>What an excellent ghazi sultan and just shah,
</p><p>That no heart should be afflicted by him!
</p><p><br />
Prose
</p><p>Then [the sultan] applauded this plan of this weak ant, and he was happy and pleased because of this charitable work of auspicious joy. And it fell to the lot of 'Ali Ağa, one of the agas of the time, who later became the pasha of Egypt and is known as Keylun 'Ali Pasha, to be appointed building supervisor<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>. Many skilled masters from among the servants of the imperial palace and trustworthy intimates of the padishah<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> were gathered, and, at an auspicious time and pleasant hour, they set to work on the aforesaid water channels, clearing their surroundings and repairing them. A few days later, stories of running water flowed from every tongue, and reasonable and unreasonable rumors circulating among the people were reported to the Solomon of the age by the building supervisor in alliance with the notables. And prudent viziers, in order to show that abandonment [of the project] was appropriate and fitting, said, "It is necessary to guard and preserve the abundant treasure and resources!" and they wished to abandon this project. In their petition they said, "My felicitous padishah, this charitable provision of running water is a bounteous gift and a great act of charity. However, men of reason doubt that water can be brought to the city by squandering treasure and setting about work on the word of the architect alone, when water is neither visible nor evident. Especially since it would require the expenditure of limitless resources to make all the hills level with the [surrounding] terrain. Is this architect possessed of occult knowledge that he claims that there is such and such a quantity of water? Does he not know that treasuries were emptied and many fountains' water lines prepared, and that the water [still] flowed away in the other direction? It is obvious that not every water channel is evidence of water, nor is there in every green field a cool spring."
</p><p><br />
Couplet
</p><p>This is not water, but merely a fantasy.
</p><p>All its sources are but a mirage.
</p><p><br />
So saying, they by degrees caused the delight that the water had given the late [sultan] to forsake and abandon him so that, with the fire of anger, the sun that habitually illumined the world set out with the aim of tormenting [my] wretched and unsettled heart. Unaware of these events, this humble servant [7a] was preparing to dam the upper reaches of these streams, collecting however much water there was in each to channel it through waterspouts. Just as I was about to start work on the last stream in the direction of the city, my felicitous padishah, [who] at other times would come to hunt as a way of keeping an eye [on the project], appeared suddenly, alone and in great haste. The building supervisor and this humble servant stood greeting him. When His Majesty the padishah demanded, "Architect! How much water is there in this stream?" this servant answered, "My felicitous padishah, that which was estimated was written down. Its [rate of flow] is five waterspouts." When I said this, the building supervisor aggressively [i.e., ironically] interfered and said, "My padishah, your servant the architect is skilled as a perfect master in the science of wonders. He knows the [amount of] water that is concealed beneath the ground, as if it were on the surface. On this matter, he has reached
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="120">120</span></h2>
<p>"a rare conclusion contrary to [that of] the common people." When he said this, I realized that there had been much malicious talk about this matter. It was necessary that I give the felicitous padishah a correct response. I therefore prayed and said,

</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I should reveal the fountain of life?
</p><p>But in my science I am very much a master. 
</p><p>O Khusraw<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>, I am a Ferhad in your service.

</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Be to you, Solomon, a guide in this auspicious work.
</p><p>May God do justice to those who hinder good works!
</p><p>May this pure source find its destination!
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Let rich and poor drink, morning and evening!
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And let them offer up prayers for the padishah!
</p><p><br />
Seeing the padishah approach, I had taken care to send men to the streams that flowed above to prepare their waterspouts. When His Majesty the padishah, the refuge of the universe, demanded, "Well, where is the water that was mentioned? Come and show me!" we set out. And when, stumbling like a lifeless corpse, I reached the second stream, I became weak, and fervently praying to God the All Bounteous, that Judge who satisfies the wants of all and never spurns supplication, I said,

</p><p>Thou art free from all abomination!

</p><p>Make me not base and contemptible before the shah!
</p><p><br />
Then we reached that stream that had been reported to contain thirty spouts of water. Timbers and spouts had been installed and in addition to the thirty spouts that flowed, ten more spouts of water overflowed. When the felicitous padishah saw that clear water, he regained some of his delight and said, "Architect! Come here! Is this all the water there is or is there more in other places?"
</p><p>Upon his asking this, I said, "Yes, my felicitous padishah, an amount of water similar to this is now flowing in two other streams in the padishah's domain. My padishah, the [quantity of water] that was reported was one hundred spouts, but there are certainly fifty spouts in excess of this. Even in the heat of midsummer, the supply of water will never be less than this." And I prayed,
</p><p><br />
Verses
</p><p>My padishah, may all that the world contains flow always
</p><p>Into your presence<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> like water!
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May your words, like the fountain of life,
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Always give joy to those yearning for delight.

</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May glory and good fortune always be your companions!
</p><p><br />
From there I, together with my felicitous padishah, set out for another stream, and when he saw there, likewise, many spouts of water flowing, he drank from that pure water with joy, and deciding to embark on this charitable work with heart and soul, he proceeded to another stream. Observing there as well the pure water's charming flow, the frown passed from his blessed brows, and the surge of the sea of his wrath was completely calmed. He elevated this humble servant with robes of honor and delightful gifts, and distinguished me from my peers in many ways.

<p>The late padishah, refuge of the world, said, "It is my intention that this water should flow to every quarter. Let fountains be constructed in places where it is possible, and in elevated places, where fountains are not feasible, let wells be dug and the water channels pass through them so that the old and feeble widows and small children can everywhere fill their jugs and pitchers and pray for the continuation of my reign!"

</p><p>Glory of the sultans of the world:
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sultan Süleyman brought fountains.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was no end or limit to his pious deeds.
</p><p>The surveyors of the time say,
</p><p>Water is an enduring gift.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That shah poured out riches for the water channels.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Let those who drink pray [for him] morning and evening!
</p><p>Just as the Nile perpetually [refreshes] the people of Egypt,
</p><p>He freed from thirst the people of Istanbul.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He drew his sword and endeavored to slay the unbelievers.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alas, he gave his life in the course of a ghaza.
</p><p>He penetrated the lands of the Bulgar, Franks, and Russians.
</p><p>He seized all the fortresses of Hungary.
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He built enduring hospices and madrasas
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And erected mosques and hospitals.

</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O brother, there is no work of charity like water!
</p><p>Every fountain is like a water carrier by the road,
</p><p>Standing and saying to all, "Water, for the sake of God!"
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Let him who wishes to lay up pious works along the way,
</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Build a fountain for the sake of God!
</p><p>It is [Sinan's] hope that he who from this water pleasure takes,

Initial work on the waterworks was begun in the second century, during the reign of the emperor Hadrian. In the fourth century the emperor Valens constructed the great aqueduct that bears his name (known to the Turks as the Bozdoğan Aqueduct). Additions to the system were made in the reigns of the emperors Theodosius (r. 379-95) and Justinian (r. 527- 65). A reworking and expansion of the system was carried out by Sultan Süleyman in the sixteenth century, when a series of dams was built to the north of the city, including those of Topuz, Belgrade, Kirazlı, Ayvad, and Cebeciköy. The most important and monumental aqueducts were the Uzunkemer, Kovukkemer, Mağlovakemer and Gözlücekemer; see Kazım Çeçen, Sinan's Water Supply System in Istanbul (Istanbul: T.C.

The full story runs as follows: One day, Ferhad was summoned to the castle of a Christian princess, Shirin, and charged with digging a canal through the mountains from the pasture lands where her herds grazed to her castle in order that a constant supply of milk be made available to her. On seeing Shirin, Ferhad was immediately smitten. After completion of the project, as a reward, Shirin offered him gold and jewels. But Ferhad, distraught with love, fled into the desert. In the meantime, King Khusraw, hearing of this, sent a messenger to Ferhad with the promises of Shirin's hand if he would cut a road through the great Mount Bisutun. Ferhad agreed to the task and succeeded in fulfilling the charge, whereupon Khusraw, filled with anger and intending to escape his promise, sent a messenger to Ferhad with the false information that Shirin was dead. Ferhad, feeling life was no longer possible, threw himself from a high rock and met his death; see E. J. W. Gibb, A History of Ottoman Poetry, ed. Edward G. Brown (1902-9; rpt.

Elsewhere, Sinan refers to his initial training in the "hearth of Hacı Bektaş" (see n. 37). Husayn, the martyred younger son of 'Ali and grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, was recognized as the third Shi'ite Imam. Following the death of the caliph Mu'awiyya in 61/680, Husayn refused to recognize the succession to the caliphate of Mu'awiyya's son Yazid, and as a result he and 600 followers were attacked by 'Ubayd Allah b. Ziyad, the Umayyad governor of Iraq, at Karbala, on the lower Euphrates. Cut off from water, Husayn parleyed with the Umayyad loyalists but finally, after eight days, mounted his horse and went into battle where, weakened by thirst, he was killed (10 Muharrem 61/October 10, 680). Only two of his children survived the massacre that followed. Although the martyrdom of Husayn had little effect on the political situation at the time, it later became the central event in the history of Twelver Shi'ism. 'Ali's two sons Husayn and Hasan were also revered in the Sunni Ottoman Empire; their names often complement those of the four caliphs in the inscription program of Sinan's religious monuments.</span>
